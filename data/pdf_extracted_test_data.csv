Optical System
Type 3, 4, and 5 distributions 
available. 
LED Thermal Management
The housing design allows the one 
piece housing to provide excellent 
thermal management critical to long 
LED system life.
Infrared Motion Response
Integral IMRI module is a passive 
infrared (PIR) motion sensor 
mounted integral on driver enclosure 
and is available with a sensor lens 
type to accommodate mounting 
heights up to 40’ and occupancy 
coverage area up to 2,800 sq.ft (60’ 
in diameter). Motion response for 
option IMRI is set/operates in the 
following fashion: 
When motion is detected by the PIR 
sensor, the luminaire goes to full 
power/ light output. 
Dimming on low is factory set to 30% 
with 5 minute default in ""full power"" 
prior to dimming back to low. When 
no motion is detected for 5 minutes, 
the motion response system reduces 
the wattage by 70%, to 30% of the 
normal constant wattage reducing 
the light level. 
Mounting
Standard luminaire arm mounts to 
square poles. Round pole adapter 
included with every luminaire 
designed for 4” OD poles.
Energy Saving Benefits 
System efficacy up to 126lms/W with 
significant energy savings over Pulse 
Start Metal Halide luminaires. 
Listings
UL/cUL listed to the UL 1598 
standard, suitable for Wet Locations. 
Suitable for use in ambient from -40° 
to 40°C (-40° to 104°F).
All product configurations are 
DesignLights Consortium® qualified. 
Finish
Each luminaire receives a fade and 
abrasion resistant, electrostatically 
applied, thermally cured, triglycidal 
isocyanurate (TGIC) textured 
polyester powdercoat finish. 
Standard color is bronze (BZ).
Limited Warranty
Luminaires, LED arrays, and 
drivers are all covered by a 5-year 
limited warranty. See philips.com/
warranties for details.

ELECTRONICS 
Upon failure of the normal utility power, a solid-state transfer switch 
automatically activates the emergency LED lamp-heads. Upon resumption  
of normal utility power, the battery is disconnected from the load and 
recharged through a micro-controller based 3-stage charger. The battery  
is a maintenance-free Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) type. The EVHC 
series accepts 120 through 277VAC at 50 or 60 Hz. A low voltage battery 
disconnect (LVD) feature protects the battery from severe damage  
during prolonged power failures. Manual testing is available at any time  
using the push-to-test button.
The EVHCR2 can be mounted up to 53’ using 18 gage wire.

EASYID ALERT SYSTEM
This unit includes a highly visual alert system to  communicate two failure modes which consist 
of “Replace Battery” or “Replace Unit”. The system works in conjunction with the Spectron Self-
Test/Self-Diagnostic functionality. If a malfunction occurs, the unit will flash a Service Alert code 
which is associated with either failure mode. In the case of REPLACE BATTERY, a new battery 
must be installed.  In the case of REPLACE UNIT, the unit  must be replaced. When the unit is in 
a serviceable condition, neither of the  failure modes are illuminated and the green LED is On. 
Additional information can be found on the Instruction Sheet.

INTEGRATED SENSOR
The Encounter and Encounter HP with Integrated Sensor technology provides automatic energy savings without sacrificing 	
	
performance. 
Traditionally, these types of energy savings required coordination between the luminaire and a lighting control 	
	
	
system. 
The Encounter delivers superior lighting with integrated occupancy and daylighting controls.   
Capture the benefits of traditional lighting controls, without complicated coverage planning or special wiring.  		
	
	
	
Ideal for new construction or retrofit, the Encounter delivers automatic ON to an energy saving light level, 	
	
	
	
	
while ensuring lighting is turned OFF when the space is unoccupied.
The integral daylight sensor reduces the need for special daylight zone planning. Each luminaire will 	
	
	
	
	
automatically adjust the light level based on reflected light beneath the sensor in a closed loop method.
Occupied daylight light levels and unoccupied light levels can be adjusted using the integrated sensor 	
	
	
	
programming remote (Catalog Number: ISHH-01). 
The integrated sensor personal remote (Catalog Number: ISHH-02) 	
	
	
	
provides code compliant manual raise, lower, ON, OFF control. 
The Encounter with Integrated Sensor is easy to install with no special wiring and ensures energy savings out-of-the-box 	 	
	
	
with default control settings. 
How it works: 
•	 As the user enters the space controlled by the integral sensor, the lighting turns ON to the default daylight level.  
•	 Lighting will remain at that the daylight level until the space is unoccupied. 
This will start the occupancy timeout period (default 20 minutes).
•	 If the space remains unoccupied for half of the timeout period, the lighting will automatically reduce to the Energy Saver light level.  
This adjustable 	 	
	 light level is typically half of the occupied daylight level. 
•	 At the end of the timeout period the lighting will go to the unoccupied light level.  
This adjustable light level uses the OFF default setting.

Specifications
Optical System
Direct hemisphere: Light emitted from a linear array of downward-facing 
LEDs is laterally redirected using optical microstructures embedded in a 
layer of MesoOptics DX film to generate an optimal batwing distribution and 
a uniform continuum of light. The available Flush Silk lens is a value-oriented 
option that provides a lambertian distribution while maintaining a uniform 
continuum of light.
Additionally, Ledalite's unique Quad Optic Louver Cell provides 6 tailored 
optical distributions with reduced glare.
Indirect hemisphere: White light emitted from a linear array of upward-facing 
LEDs is shaped into a homogeneous, wide-throw batwing distribution or a 
low peak angle asymmetric throw using either a free-form elliptical lens or an 
engineered light guide panel.
Housing
Post painted precision aluminum extrusion.

Photometry
1.	 4ft Luminaire photometry has been conducted in accordance with IES LM-79-08. IES files can be downloaded by clicking the links in the table above, or online at ledalite.com.  Luminaires with finishes other than 
standard white may result in a drop in flux and efficacy.
2.	 Unified Glare Ratio (UGR) is calculated in accordance with CIE 117-1995. Reference conditions of 4Hx8Hx1H and reflectances of 70/50/20% have been applied using the procedure described in CIE 190-2010.

Photometry
1.	 4ft Luminaire photometry has been conducted in accordance with IES LM-79-08. IES files can be downloaded by clicking the links in the table above, or online at ledalite.com.  Luminaires with finishes other than 
standard white may result in a drop in flux and efficacy.
2.	 Unified Glare Ratio (UGR) is calculated in accordance with CIE 117-1995. Reference conditions of 4Hx8Hx1H and reflectances of 70/50/20% have been applied using the procedure described in CIE 190-2010.
3.	 For Photometry reports and IES files combining Direct/Indirect distributions other than those listed above, please consult Ledalite.

Candela plot shown is for 3000lm/4ft Direct / 5000lm/4ft Indirect, CRI 90, 3500K configuration.
1.	 4ft Luminaire photometry has been conducted in accordance with IES LM-79-08. IES files can be downloaded by clicking the links in the table above, or online at ledalite.com.  Luminaires with finishes other than 
standard white may result in a drop in flux and efficacy.
2.	 Unified Glare Ratio (UGR) is calculated in accordance with CIE 117-1995. Reference conditions of 4Hx8Hx1H and reflectances of 70/50/20% have been applied using the procedure described in CIE 190-2010.
3.	 For Photometry reports and IES files combining Direct/Indirect distributions other than those listed above, please consult Ledalite.

Control Options
0-10V This ﬁxture is offered standard with 0-10V dimming driver(s) for use with a lighting control panel or other control method.
Photocontrol (PC1, PC2 and PC) Optional button-type photocontrol provides a ﬂexible solution to enable “dusk-to-dawn” lighting by sensing light levels.   
After Hours Dim (AHD) This feature allows photocontrol-enabled luminaires to achieve additional energy savings by dimming during scheduled portions of the night. The 
dimming proﬁle will automatically take effect after a “dusk-to-dawn” period has been calculated from the photocontrol input. Specify the desired dimming proﬁle for a simple, 
factory-shipped dimming solution requiring no external control wiring. Reference the After Hours Dim supplemental guide for additional information.
Dimming Occupancy Sensor (MSP/DIM-LXX and MSP-LXX) These sensors are factory installed in the luminaire housing. When the MSP/DIM-LXX sensor option is selected, 
the occupancy sensor is connected to a dimming driver and the entire luminaire dims when there is no activity detected. When activity is detected, the luminaire returns to full 
light output. The MSP/DIM sensor is factory preset to dim down to approximately 50 percent power with a time delay of ten minutes. The MSP-LXX sensor is factory preset to 
turn the luminaire off after ﬁve minutes of no activity. 
These occupancy sensors includes an integrated photocell that can be activated with the ISHH-01 accessory for “dusk-to-dawn” control or daylight harvesting - the factory 
preset is ON. The ISHH-01 is a wireless tool utilized for changing the dimming level, time delay, sensitivity and other parameters.
A variety of sensor lens are available to optimize the coverage pattern for mounting heights from 8’-30’.
WaveLinx Wireless Control and Monitoring System  The WaveLinx Outdoor control platform operates on a wireless mesh network based on IEEE 802.15.4 standards 
enabling wireless control of outdoor lighting. Use the WaveLinx Mobile application for set-up and conﬁguration. At least one Wireless Area Controller (WAC) is required for full 
functionality and remote communication (including adjustment of any factory pre-sets). 
 
WaveLinx Wireless Sensor (WPS2 and WPS4) These outdoor sensors offer passive infrared (PIR) occupancy and a photocell for closed loop daylight sensing. These sensors 
are factory preset to dim down to approximately 50 percent power after 15 minutes of no activity detected. These occupancy sensors include an integral photocell for “dusk-
to-dawn” control or daylight harvesting that is factory-enabled. A variety of sensor lenses are available to optimize the coverage pattern for mounting heights from 7’-40’.
Enlighted Wireless Control and Monitoring System (LWR-LW and LWR-LN)  The Enlighted System is a connected lighting solution that combines LED luminaires with an 
integrated wireless sensor system. The sensor controls the lighting system in compliance with the latest energy codes and collects valuable data about building performance 
and use. Software applications turn the granular data into information through energy dashboards and specialized apps that make it simple and help optimize the use of other 
resources beyond lighting. 
This ﬁxture is offered standard with 0-10V dimming driver(s) for use with a lighting control panel or other control method.

Optional button-type photocontrol provides a ﬂexible solution to enable “dusk-to-dawn” lighting by sensing light levels.    
After Hours Dim (AHD)
This feature allows photocontrol-enabled luminaires to achieve additional energy savings by dimming during scheduled portions of the night. 
The dimming proﬁle will automatically take effect after a “dusk-to-dawn” period has been calculated from the photocontrol input. Specify the 
desired dimming proﬁle for a simple, factory-shipped dimming solution requiring no external control wiring. Reference the After Hours Dim 
supplemental guide for additional information.
Dimming Occupancy Sensor (MSP/DIM-LXX and MSP-LXX)
These sensors are factory installed in the luminaire housing. When the MSP/DIM-LXX sensor option is selected, the occupancy sensor is connected 
to a dimming driver and the entire luminaire dims when there is no activity detected. When activity is detected, the luminaire returns to full light 
output. The MSP/DIM sensor is factory preset to dim down to approximately 50 percent power with a time delay of ten minutes. The MSP-LXX 
sensor is factory preset to turn the luminaire off after ﬁve minutes of no activity. 
These occupancy sensors includes an integrated photocell that can be activated with the ISHH-01 accessory for “dusk-to-dawn” control or daylight 
harvesting - the factory preset is ON. The ISHH-01 is a wireless tool utilized for changing the dimming level, time delay, sensitivity and other 
parameters.
A variety of sensor lens are available to optimize the coverage pattern for mounting heights from 8’-30’.
Enlighted Wireless Control and Monitoring System (LWR-LW and LWR-LN)
The Enlighted System is a connected lighting solution that combines LED luminaires with an integrated wireless sensor system. The sensor 
controls the lighting system in compliance with the latest energy codes and collects valuable data about building performance and use. Software 
applications turn the granular data into information through energy dashboards and specialized apps that make it simple and help optimize the 
use of other resources beyond lighting.

The WaveLinx Outdoor control platform operates on a wireless mesh network based on IEEE 802.15.4 standards enabling wireless control of 
outdoor lighting. Use the WaveLinx Mobile application for set-up and conﬁguration. At least one Wireless Area Controller (WAC) is required for 
full functionality and remote communication (including adjustment of any factory pre-sets).
WaveLinx Wireless Sensor (SWPD4 and SWPD5) These outdoor sensors offer passive infrared (PIR) occupancy and a photocell for closed loop 
daylight sensing. These sensors can be factory installed or ﬁeld-installed via simple, tool-less integration into luminaires equipped with the 
Zhaga Book 18 compliant 4-PIN receptacle (ZW). These sensors are factory preset to dim down to approximately 50 percent power after 
15 minutes of no activity detected. These occupancy sensors include an integral photocell for ""dusk-to-dawn"" control or daylight harvesting that 
is factory-enabled. A variety of sensor lenses are available to optimize the coverage pattern for mounting heights from 7'-40'.

ACOUSTIC PERFORMANCE DATA
DIMENSIONS + WEIGHT
ALL SABIN PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO ACOUSTIC TESTING. PERFORMANCE 
VALUES WILL VARY BASED ON INSTALLATION FACTORS SUCH AS DENSITY AND 
MOUNTING HEIGHT.
SABINS
A SABIN IS A UNIT OF SOUND ABSORPTION DEFINED AS THE AMOUNT OF 
SOUND ABSORBED BY ONE SQUARE FOOT OF A PERFECT ABSORBER. 
IT WAS INITIALLY CONCEIVED AS THE EQUIVALENT OF 1 SQUARE FOOT 
OF OPEN WINDOW, REFLECTING NO SOUND BACK INTO THE INTERIOR. 
SABINS ARE USED TO EXPRESS THE TOTAL EFFECTIVE ABSORPTION FOR 
THE INTERIOR OF A ROOM. THIS CHART INDICATES AVERAGE SABINS PER 
UNIT AT THE NOTED FREQUENCIES WHICH REPRESENT THE TYPICAL 
RANGE OF HUMAN SPEECH OF 200-2500 HZ.
NRC
NOISE REDUCTION COEFFICIENT (NRC) IS A SINGLE NUMBER VALUE 
RANGING FROM 0.0 TO 1.0 THAT DESCRIBES THE AVERAGE SOUND 
ABSORPTION PERFORMANCE OF A MATERIAL. AN NRC OF 0.0 INDICATES 
THE OBJECT DOES NOT ABSORB MID-FREQUENCY SOUND ENERGY, BUT 
REFLECTS IT. AN NRC OF 1.0 INDICATES THAT THE SOUND ABSORPTION 
PERFORMANCE OF THE MATERIAL IS EQUAL TO ITS SURFACE AREA 
(MEASURED IN UNITS SABIN), OR CONCEPTUALLY 100% SOUND 
ABSORPTION.
PROJECTED NRC = .95
TOTAL SOUND ABSORPTION WILL VARY BASED ON DESIGNED PRODUCT CONFIGURATION.
SABIN TESTS ALL PRODUCTS IN MULTIPLE CONFIGURATIONS.
PLEASE CONTACT SABIN OR YOUR LOCAL AGENT FOR MORE INFORMATION.
PLEASE CONSULT THE FACTORY FOR PRODUCT WEIGHTS BASED ON CONFIGURATION AND PART NUMBERS.

FEATURES & SPECIFICATIONS
INTENDED USE — Ideal one-for-one replacement of conventional HID and fluo-
rescent high bay systems. Applications include warehousing, manufacturing, gymnasiums, 
and other large indoor spaces with mounting heights up to 60'. Certain airborne con-
taminants can diminish the integrity of acrylic and/or polycarbonate. 
 
Click here for Acrylic-Polycarbonate Compatibility table for suitable uses.
CONSTRUCTION — Lightweight aluminum heat sink designed to perform in ambient temperatures up to 
55 ° C with lumen droop less than fluorescent due to precision thermal engineering for maximum naturally 
convective cooling. Structural elements such as the channel and end caps are fabricated from steel for 
maximum rigidity. Hard-tooled reflectors, utilizing reflective Alanod® MIRO-5® aluminum, for precise and 
repeatable photometry. Semi-diffuse lens optional to provide glare control – may be inverted for gloss or 
matte side down. Wireguard attachment points provided.
OPTICS — Narrow and wide distributions available to meet both horizontal and vertical light level 
requirements. Reflectors feature precision-formed optics utilizing reflective Alanod® MIRO-5® aluminum 
to achieve narrow distribution and white polyester powder coat to achieve wide distri bution. Semi-
diffuse lens optional to provide glare control and LED protection.
ELECTRICAL — L95 at 60,000 hours (only 5% loss) with a predicted life of more than 100,000 hours. Utilizes 
a 90°C case temperature driver for maximum life at high temperatures. 0.90 power factor and 10kA/10kV 
level of surge protection is standard.  Available as 120-277V or 347-480V input.
0-10V dimming standard for a dimming range of 100% to 10%; dimming source current is 150 microA.
INSTALLATION — Suitable for suspension by chain, cable, surface-mounting bracket, hook monopoint 
or single (pendant) monopoint. Surface mounting not recommended without optional surface mounting 
bracket. To maintain high ambient listing, fixture should be mounted at a minimum plenum height of 24"".
LISTINGS — CSA certified to US and Canadian safety standards. Damp location listed. Suitable for ambi-
ent temperatures from -40°F (-40°C) to 131°F (55°C) when suspended 24"" from ceiling. Patent pending.

light in a broad range of continuously variable color temperatures and intensities. Create 
a dynamic environment by adjusting the ambient light warmer or cooler to influence mood, 
support the task at hand, or create a dramatic ambience. The ability to control correlated 
color temperature and intensity separately using simple controls is the next evolution 
of LED lighting for the commercial, educational, healthcare and hospitality space. The 
unparalleled flexibility and number of available lighting environments enable users to find 
the right light with tunable white. 
Performance Data
Controlling VividTune Tunable White
VividTune luminaires make tunable white more accessible by using simple and familiar 
controls. From wall dimmers to wireless controls, VividTune tunable white luminaires are 
compatible with industry standard 0-10V dimming controls. A single  
0-10V dimming input is used to control intensity (brightness) while a second 0-10V 
dimming input is used to adjust CCT. For suggested control configurations,  
go to www.cooperlighting.com for tunable white application guides.

The InDepth with factory-installed tilemount sensor provides automatic energy savings 
without sacrificing performance. The InDepth delivers superior lighting with luminaire 
occupancy and daylighting control.
For standalone and controlled applications, the WaveLinx Lite sensor provides out-of-the-
box functionality with no gateways required and factory startup is not needed.
When more connectivity is required, the WaveLinx Pro Wireless sensor meets modern 
code and utility requirements, delivers energy and cost savings, while enabling buildings 
to become smart buildings.
The WaveLinx Wireless Connected Lighting System combined with Trellix provides an 
open IoT platform and infrastructure that connects intelligent sensors leveraging the 
real-estate of the physical light fixture to solve higher complexity problems to deliver 
actionable insights through the aggregation of valuable data.

The SQ4 with WaveLinx offers no-hassle lighting control with multiple luminaire level control 
solutions.
WaveLinx PRO is a wireless lighting control solution, for connected spaces, that 
significantly reduces a building’s energy consumption. From a single floor to an entire 
campus, WaveLinx PRO connects more than lighting assets; it shares aggregated 
sensor data with the WaveLinx CORE platform and other building systems, so 
building owners can improve operations, spaces environment, and tenants' 
experience. WaveLinx PRO offers a rich portfolio of wireless devices, WaveLinx 
PRO-enabled luminaires, and an intuitive WaveLinx mobile app for office, education, 
warehouse, and parking garage applications.
WaveLinx LITE is a cost effective, wireless digital lighting control solution, with 
out-of-the-box functionality, that saves energy and meets code. It’s designed for 
applications that require occupancy-based, daylighting, or manual light control. 
Customize installations for office, education, warehouse and parking garages using 
the secure, simple mobile app.

LUMEN MAINTENANCE 
Designed to last with cool running mid-power LEDs projected 
to maintain 90% (L90) of their initial output for 100,000 hours 
(at HO), and L70 exceeding 150,000 hours.
LED SYSTEM
LED modules and drivers are field replaceable.
PROG
(OPTIONAL)
Programmable light output. Specify desired lumens or watts 
per linear foot. Min: 21/2 w/ft, consult factory for requests 
above 12 w/ft.
BINNING
Standard binning (all Prudential LED boards) includes testing 
at the chip level and board integration to provide consistent 
color temperature within a 3-step MacAdams ellipse, with +/- 
5% lumen output range and +/- .004 Duv.
LABELS
CSA and ETL damp labeled and I.B.E.W. manufactured.
ELECTRICAL
Must specify LED dimming controls. LED fixtures have 
constant current driver(s) with less than 20% THD when 
loaded to a minimum of 60%. Drivers sink a maximum of 6mA 
per driver. DM01 LED drivers are 0-10V dimmable and are 
compatible with most 0-10V wall slide dimmers and direct 
0-10V analog signal dimmers. 
CONSTRUCTION
Housing

How to Estimate Delivered Lumens in Emergency Mode
Use the formula below to estimate the delivered lumens in emergency mode
Delivered Lumens = P x LPW
P = Output power of emergency driver
LPW = Lumen per watt rating of the luminaire. (See chart on page 4)
The LPW rating is also available at Designlight Consortium
P = 10 watts for EM10WCP

How to Estimate Delivered Lumens in Emergency Mode
Use the formula below to estimate the delivered lumens in emergency mode
Delivered Lumens = P x LPW
P = Output power of emergency driver.
LPW = Lumen per watt rating of the luminaire. (See charts on Page 6)
The LPW rating is also available at Designlight Consortium.
P = 10W for FE10WCP

EMERGENCY LUMEN OUTPUT EXAMPLE – 10 WATT BATTERY
How to Estimate Delivered Lumens in Emergency Mode
Use the formula below to estimate the delivered lumens in emergency mode
Delivered Lumens = P x LPW
P = Output power of emergency driver.
LPW = Lumen per watt rating of the luminaire. (See charts on Page 4)
The LPW rating is also available at Designlight Consortium.
P = 10 watts for E10WLCP
P = 14 watts for FE14WCP

Madeira® LED
As shown: Acorn style with replica chimney, 
ornamental crown, and decorative ribs
Optical Assembly 
The optical assembly is a precisely molded thermal resistant 
borosilicate glass reflector and retractor. The upper portion of this 
system incorporates a series of reflecting prisms that redirect over 
50% of the upward light into the controlling retractor while allowing 
a soft uplight component to define the traditional acorn shape. The 
lower portion uses precisely molded refracting prisms to control the 
distribution of light to maximize utilization, uniformity, and luminaire 
spacing. The top of this assembly is a removable decorative aluminum 
cover with a replica chimney finial for entry into the lamp chamber. 
A total of eight decorative ribs surround the prismatic glass reflector 
and refractor. Three unique optical assemblies are available, designed 
for IES type Ill, type IV, and type V distribution. 
Luminaire Housing 
A decorative leaf style cast aluminum luminaire housing cradles the 
optical assembly and provides an enclosure for the plug-in electrical 
module. The three station incoming line terminal block is prewired 
to a six conductor receptacle for ease in connecting the electrical 
module. A slipfitter will accept a 3 inch high by 2-7/8 inch to 3-1/8 
inch O.D. pipe tenon. 
Electrical Module / Luminaire Housing Door 
The decorative leaf style cast aluminum housing door contains the 
ballast components and is held in place by two captive 1/4-20 stainless 
steel screws. A matching six conductor plug connects to the receptacle 
in the luminaire housing to complete the wiring. 
Electrical Module 
The electronic components are mounted on a steel plate that is 
removable with minimum use of tools. A matching six conductor 
plug connects to the receptacle in the luminaire housing to complete 
the wiring. 
Electronic Driver 
AS drivers are programmable dimmable drivers, with 0-10V control 
leads and AH drivers are dimmable (0-10V) drivers .
Finish/ Material 
All castings utilize aluminum for maximum corrosion resistance and 
all exposed hardware is corrosion resistant. 
The finish shall:
•	 Utilize a polyester power coat paint to ensure maximum durability
•	 Rigorous multi-stage pre-treating and painting process yields a 
finish that achieves a scribe creepage rating of 8 (per ASTM D1654) 
after over 5000 hours exposure to salt fog chamber (operated per 
ASTM B117) on standard and RAL finish options.
•	 RAL (RALxxxxSDCR) paint colors are Super Durable Corrosion 
Resistant, 80% gloss.
Installation 
Refer to the instruction manual provided with each luminaire as to the 
specific method of wiring and mounting the luminaire.

Lumen Ambient Temperature (LAT) Multipliers
Use these factors to determine relative lumen output for 
average ambient temperatures from 0-40°C (32-104°F).
Projected LED Lumen Maintenance
Data references the extrapolated performance projections for the platforms noted in a 25°C ambient, based on 10,000 hours of 
LED testing (tested per IESNA LM-80-08 and projected per IESNA TM-21-11 ).
To calculate LLF, use the lumen maintenance factor that corresponds to the desired number of operating hours below. For other 
lumen maintenance values, contact factory.
The italicized data is extrapolated beyond the TM-21 standard.
E = (LM) x (CU) x (LAT) x (LLD)
LM and CU are obtained from published photometry.

Field Adjustable Output Module
The Field Adjustable Output (AO) 
module is an onboard device 
that adjusts the light output 
and input wattage to meet site 
specific requirements, allowing a 
single fixture configuration to be

Lowering Device
Catalog Number
Notes
Type
Construction
The lowering device shall consist of three main sub-assemblies; head frame, lowering ring and winch assembly. All material shall 
be of corrosive resistant nature including stainless steel, aluminum or galvanized steel unless otherwise specified. All fixtures 
utilized on the lowering device shall have passed an accelerated vibration test of at least 1G.
Head Frame:  The head frame shall consist of one-piece welded assembly with hot dip galvanized finish after fabrication. All 
fasteners used for additional covers or other item shall be stainless steel. The head frame shall incorporate six hoist cable sheaves. 
The sheaves shall meet or exceed the requirements of the Wire Rope Technical Board. Wire rope cables that operate over the sheaves 
shall by 7 X 19 construction Ø3/16"" or Ø1/4"" aircraft cable, as specified, either zinc coated or stainless steel.
Top Latching:  Three one-piece cast aluminum latch barrels shall be provided on the head frame assembly. Each latch barrel 
shall be designed to hold the entire weight of the ring and luminaires.
Ring Assembly:  The ring shall be fabricated of #7-gauge steel with a hot dip galvanized finish. The assembly shall include the 
appropriate number of luminaires mounting arm brackets fabricated from 2IN pipe of sufficient strength to support the specified 
luminaire. The mounting arms shall be hot dip galvanized finished and shall bolt to the ring with stainless steel hardware.
Self-centering ring assembly:  The centering system shall consist of roller contact, spring loaded, cast aluminum arms designed 
to protect the pole, luminaires, and lamps from damage during raising and lowering of the luminaire ring assembly.  The centering 
system shall keep the ring concentric to the pole during the raising and lowering operation.
Transition Assembly:  The transition assembly shall be designed to prevent misalignment of the three hoist cables. The wire 
rope cables shall be attached to the transition assembly with properly sized wire rope thimbles and factory swagged fittings. The 
attachment shall prevent the wire rope cable from untwisting under load.
Winch:  The internal winch assembly shall have an ultimate strength of five (5) times the lifted load. The winch shall include a 
30:1 worm gear reduction and an internal drag brake on the input shaft to prevent free spooling of the winch drum.  The winch 
drum shall be factory pre-wound with minimum Ø1/4"" zinc coated or stainless-steel high strength 7X19 construction aircraft cable. 
The internal winch assembly shall include a receiver bracket designed to accept the portable drive motor assembly. Provision shall 
be made to enable the drive motor assembly to be locked or pinned to the bracket during operation.
Branch Circuit Protection:  The assembly shall include a circuit breaker sized for the correct voltage and phasing supplied for 
the luminaire. A pigtail cord and plug shall be supplied from the circuit breaker assembly. The cord and plug shall match the main 
power cord of the lowering device system.
Drive Motor:  The drive motor assembly shall include a minimum 1hp heavy duty reversing type electric motor with a stalled 
torque at least twice that required to operate the lowering device. The motor shall drive the winch through a torque limiter 
coupling to limit the drive force on the hoist and winch cables. The torque limiter shall be factory pre-set. In addition, there 
shall be a backup shear pin designed to shear at a torque level between 50% and 100% over the torque limiter setting. The drive 
motor assembly shall have a 20 feet cord with drum switch for remote operation. The drive motor assembly shall be supplied 
with a step-down transformer to provide 120V to the motor. The drive motor shall be portable and shall interface with the winch 
assembly to operate the lowering device.

Lowering Device
Catalog Number
Notes
Type
Construction
The lowering device shall consist of three main sub-assemblies; head frame, lowering ring and winch assembly. All material shall 
be of corrosive resistant nature including stainless steel, aluminum or galvanized steel unless otherwise specified. All fixtures 
utilized on the lowering device shall have passed an accelerated vibration test of at least 1G.
Head Frame:  The head frame shall consist of one-piece welded assembly with hot dip galvanized finish after fabrication. All 
fasteners used for additional covers or other item shall be stainless steel. The head frame shall incorporate six hoist cable sheaves. 
The sheaves shall meet or exceed the requirements of the Wire Rope Technical Board. Wire rope cables that operate over the sheaves 
shall by 7 X 19 construction aircraft cable Ø3/16"" or Ø1/4"" diameter, as specified, either zinc coated or stainless steel.
Top Latching:  Three one-piece cast aluminum latch barrels shall be provided on the head frame assembly. Each latch barrel 
shall be designed to hold the entire weight of the ring and luminaires.
Ring Assembly:  The ring shall be fabricated of #7-gauge steel with a hot dip galvanized finish. The assembly shall include the 
appropriate number of luminaires mounting arm brackets fabricated from 2"" pipe of sufficient strength to support the specified 
luminaire. The mounting arms shall be hot dip galvanized finished and shall bolt to the ring with stainless steel hardware.
Self-centering ring assembly:  The centering system shall consist of roller contact, spring loaded, cast aluminum arms designed 
to protect the pole, luminaires, and lamps from damage during raising and lowering of the luminaire ring assembly.  The centering 
system shall keep the ring concentric to the pole during the raising and lowering operation.
Transition Assembly:  The transition assembly shall be designed to prevent misalignment of the three hoist cables. The wire 
rope cables shall be attached to the transition assembly with properly sized wire rope thimbles and factory swagged fittings. The 
attachment shall prevent the wire rope cable from untwisting under load.
Branch Circuit Protection:  The assembly shall include a circuit breaker sized for the correct voltage and phasing supplied for 
the luminaire. A pigtail cord and plug shall be supplied from the circuit breaker assembly. The cord and plug shall match the main 
power cord of the lowering device system.
Portable Winch and Drive Motor:  The portable winch assembly shall have an ultimate strength of five (5) times the lifted 
load. The winch shall include a 30:1 worm gear reduction and an internal drag brake on the input shaft to prevent free spooling of 
the winch drum. The portable drive motor assembly shall include a minimum 1hp heavy duty reversing type electric motor with a 
stalled torque at least twice that required to operate the lowering device.  The motor shall drive the winch through a torque limiter 
coupling to limit the drive force on the hoist and winch cables. The torque limiter shall be factory pre-set.  In addition, there shall 
be a backup shear pin designed to shear at a torque level between 50% and 100% over the torque limiter setting. The portable 
drive motor assembly shall have a 20 feet cord with drum switch for remote operation. The portable drive motor assembly shall 
be supplied with a step-down transformer to provide 120V to the motor.

THIS DOCUMENT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE. THE PRODUCTS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND THIS DOCUMENT
ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC DISCLAIMERS, SET FORTH AT www.vishay.com/doc?91000
DESCRIPTION
Production is strictly controlled and follows an extensive
set of instructions established for reproducibility.  A
homogeneous film of metal alloy is deposited on a high
grade ceramic body.  The fuse elements are covered by a
protective coating designed for electrical, mechanical and
climatic protection.  The terminations receive a final pure tin
on nickel plating.
The result of the determined production is verified by an
extensive testing procedure performed on 100 % of the
individual fuses.  Only accepted products are laid directly
into the paper tape in accordance with IEC 60286-3.
APPROVALS
The fuses are tested in accordance with the following
standards:
• IEC 60127-1
• IEC 60127-4
• UL 248-14
• IEC 60068 series
Approval of conformity is indicated by the UMF Logo on the
package label. Recognition by Underwriter Laboratories Inc.
is indicated by the UL logo on the package label.
ASSEMBLY
The fuses are suitable for processing on automatic SMD
assembly systems. They are suitable for automatic
soldering using wave, reflow or vapour phase. The
encapsulation is resistant to all cleaning solvents commonly
used in the electronics industry, including alcohols, esters
and aqueous solutions.  The fuses are RoHS compliant, the
pure tin plating provides compatibility with lead (Pb)-free
and lead-containing soldering processes.  The immunity of
the plating against tin whisker growth has been proven
under extensive testing.  Solderability is specified for 2 years
after production or re-qualification.  The permitted storage
time is 20 years.
All products comply with the JIG 101 list of legal restrictions

HOW 10 USE CAPACITORS FOR MULTI-SPEED BLOWERS 
It is possible to make any ebm blower with a PSC 
motor a multi­
speed blower by adding a second or third capacitor on the load line 
(blue) at or near the value of the motor run capacitor. Actual capacitor 
value and RPM achieved are dependent on the nature of each 
application.

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics 
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard- 
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
 
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low 
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings, 
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics 
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard- 
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
 
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low 
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings, 
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics 
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard- 
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
 
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low 
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings, 
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics 
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard- 
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
 
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low 
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings, 
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

Material Summary Sheet 7
Aearo Technologies LLC  •  a 3M company

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics 
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard- 
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
 
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low 
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings, 
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

Material Summary Sheet 7
Aearo Technologies LLC  •  a 3M company

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics 
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard- 
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
 
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low 
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings, 
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics 
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard- 
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
 
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low 
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings, 
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

Our history – Our drive
Rooted in ebm, PAPST and mvl, the three leading innovators in the
development and production of motors and fans, ebm-papst has
established itself as the world market leader. Now as ever, our legendary
inventive spirit shines through in products that set standards in many
segments of industry worldwide. We are proud to say that despite difficult
competition, our performance has always been exemplary and outstand-
ing – in business, in our personal relationship with our customers, and of
course with respect to technology and engineering. For decades, we have
contributed to the world of air technology and drive engineering with
small revolutions and large milestones.
To maintain this advantage in skills and knowledge to get maximum
quality and thus the highest degree of customer satisfaction, our
employees around the world put their passion and dedication to work
for you.
Passionately involved in R&D
Our catalogues just list the results of our incessant efforts in R&D:
products of highest quality and reliability. After all, it is our passion to
constantly try something new and improve what we have. In doing so,
we take advantage of the latest development methods and state-of-
the-art technology and invest quite heavily in R&D facilities. Best of all,
though, we rely on excellently trained and skilled engineers and
technicians to be at your service in R&D and Sales & Distribution.
Producing and safeguarding high-quality products and services
This is our promise without any compromise. Whether produced in one of
our six factories in Germany or one of our eleven international production
sites, our products always have the same high level of quality. This quality
control is something you can definitely rely on! And this across all levels
of production and throughout all processes: consulting customers, devel-
opment, material selection through to picking certified, choice suppliers
and on to the production of parts and final delivery. On top of this, our
products have to pass the most rigorous tests under all realistic operating
conditions: continuous stress test, salt spray test, vibration test, or preci-
sion noise measuring, just to mention a few. And the product gets
clearance for serial production only after all the
desired characteristics have been determined to
be just right.
Environmental care is another priority with
ebm-papst. This is why we have developed
our product line in EC technology, which makes
for very low power consumption. Due to our
manufacturing philosophy, there is absolute
focus on environmental care in production,
recycling, waste and wastewater disposal.
Global Domestic
In order to be specialist for customised solutions
throughout the world, you need strong partners.
Global Domestic – i.e. being present all over the
world and being a national company in each
individual country – is how we have established
ourselves in all important markets on this globe
with our successful subsidiaries. And so you will
always find ebm-papst close to home, speaking
your language, and knowing the demands of
your markets. Besides, our worldwide produc-
tion alliance serves as a basis for competitive
pricing. Our global services and logistic outlets,
i.e. IT networking, safeguard short reaction
times and just-in-time delivery.
All our efforts are documented in a comprehen-
sive quality management system, both for prod-
ucts and services. Being certified as complying
with the tough requirements of the international
standards DIN EN ISO 9001, ISO/TS 16949-2
and of standard DIN EN ISO 14001 is just one
seal of approval we have received for our
unceasing efforts to provide only the best
quality products and services.

Sustainability is at the centre of our
thoughts and actions. Out of conviction!
Eco-friendliness and sustainability have always been at the core of our thoughts and actions. For decades, we have worked
according to the simple but strict creed of our co-founder Gerhard Sturm: “Each new product we develop has to be better
than the last one in terms of economy and ecology.” GreenTech is the ultimate expression of our corporate philosophy.

7
GreenTech is acknowledged and certified.
Every step in our chain of production meets the stringent standards of
environmental specialists and the public. The 2008 Environmental Prize
of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the Green Award 2009, the Energy Efficiency
Award 2009 of the dena – to give just a few examples – testify to this.
The environmental advantage gained in the performance of the products
developed from our GreenTech philosophy can also be measured in the
fulfilment of the most stringent energy and environmental standards.
In many instances, our products are already well below the thresholds
energy legislation will impose a few years from now – several times over.
Our customers profit from this every day.
The heart of GreenTech is future-oriented EC technology from ebm-
papst. The EC technology at the core of our most efficient motors and
fans allows efficiency of up to 90%, saves energy at a very high level,
significantly extends service life and makes our products maintenance-
free. These values pay off not only for the environment, but every cent al-
so pays off for the user! All ebm-papst products – even those for which
GreenTech EC technology does not (yet) make sense from an application
viewpoint – feature the greatest possible connection of economy and
ecology.
GreenTech is pro-active development.
Even in the design phase, the materials and processes we use are optimi-
sed for the greatest possible eco-friendliness, energy balance and –
wherever possible – recyclability.We continually improve the material
and performance of our products, as well as the flow and noise charac-
teristics.At the same time, we significantly reduce energy consumption.
Close co-operation with universities and scientific institutes and the pro-
fessorship we endow in the area of power engineering and regenerative
energies allows us to profit from the latest research findings in these
fields – and at the same time ensure highly qualified young academics.
GreenTech is eco-friendly production.
GreenTech also stands for maximum energy efficiency in our production
processes. There, the intelligent use of industrial waste heat and ground-
water cooling, photovoltaics and, of course, our own cooling and venti -
lation technology are of the utmost importance. Our most modern plant,
for instance, consumes 91% less energy than currently specified and
required. In this way, our products contribute to protecting the environ-
ment, from their origin to their recyclable packaging.

Expertise and technology
Drive expertise
For the past 60 years, all conceivable types and applications of drive
engineering have played an essential role at ebm-papst. A commitment
that is the foundation for the development of optimum drive solutions –
regardless of the type of fan and its usage. DC fans are generally
equipped with electronically commutated external rotor motors; in
order to save as much space as possible, commutation electronic com-
ponents are integrated in the hub of the fan. Our AC fans are mostly
driven by shaded-pole or capacitor motors based on the external rotor
principle. In the 3900 and 9900 range of particularly slim fans, internal
rotor motors are used.
Low-noise performance
Our aerodynamically optimised design and high mechanical precision
produces outstanding noise properties in series production. So-called
“soft” commutation electronics of the DC fans ensure an excellent
noise performance. By avoiding steep switching edges when the indi-
vidual coils are switched, this reduces the structure-borne noise from
the motor. Computer-aided measurements and series of analyses per-
formed in a state-of-the-art sound measuring chamber are conducted
on each fan model from the very beginning.
Long service life
The bearing system plays a vital role both in
the long life time and quietness of device
fans. The SINTEC compact bearing provides
most of the device fans with a proven bearing
system. Constant low noise during the entire
operating time and considerably lower shock
sensitivity are the outstanding features of this
bearing technology. In addition, with regard
to temperature endurance, Sintec compact
bearings can be used without problems in
most applications. Despite the slightly higher
noise and shock sensitivity of ball bearings,
this bearing technology should be given pref-
erence for fans exposed to extreme thermal
and adverse application conditions (e.g.
extreme environmental conditions, critical
installation position, etc.). The service life data
provided in this catalogue is based on exten-
sive service life tests and mathematically /
scientifically proven service life calculations.
Our product descriptions are continuously
updated with all relevant data obtained from
long-term tests.

9
Streamline: Aerodynamics
With the aid of state-of-the-art computer programs, we are able to
optimise the fan impellers and the inner shape of the housing. Air
output and available motor performance are exactly matched with the
size of fan. This guarantees the low noise that is typical for ebm-papst,
even at high back pressure.
Sturdy construction – in metal or plastic
Fans of all-metal construction: Sturdy and indestructible. The housing
is made of an aluminium alloy whereas the metal surfaces that are
subject to corrosion are permanently protected by an impact- and
abrasion-resistant electrophoretic baked enamel. This particular ver-
sion is highly recyclable. Fans with fibreglass-reinforced plastic hous-
ing and impeller: Excellent stability and low weight distinguish
this highly efficient fan concept. Combinations of metal housing and
plastic impeller unite the advantages of both types of design.
Product images
The dimensioned drawings and product photos that appear in the catalo-
gue are for orientation purposes and may differ in some details from the
actual product design.
Product liability
Motors and fans from ebm-papst are components intended for proper
installation. The customer bears responsibility for the overall end pro-
duct.
Safety is included
It goes without saying that all ebm-papst fans
conform to the approval requirements of the
VDE (Association of German Electrical Engineers)
and the standards and regulations of UL and
CSA. All fans conform to the European Standard
EN 60335 or EN 60950 plus those of the UL
(Underwriters Laboratories) and CSA (Canadian
Standards Association).
With few exceptions, our DC fans are designed
to meet the requirements of protection class 3
/ protection class voltage. ACmaxx fans are
protection class 2 / AC fans are protection
class 1. ebm-papst fans meet the highest
requirements of electrical safety. Depending on
the type, they are either impedance protected
or equipped with a temperature safety switch,
electronic locked-rotor protection, alarm func-
tion or have speed monitoring and speed con-
trol.
Quality in detail
It is the seemingly trivial that makes the
difference when a product is labelled ‘made
by ebm-papst’: consistent maintenance of
development and design engineering specifica-
tions; target-oriented design; and assured
quality across the entire process chain are the
reasons why running times of over 150,000
hours are not unusual. The no-compromise
ebm-papst quality assurance spans over all
process levels – from the choice of materials
and the use of carefully selected, certified sup-
pliers, from the production of parts up to final
assembly. The sum of all these apparently
minor details results in fan products with supe-
rior lifetimes and reliability.

Tailor-made to meet your special requirements
ebm-papst has always developed customer-
specific intelligent fans which meet the exact
requirements of the application. We provide
a wide range of standard fan types, in many
sizes and designs; with intelligent motor featu-
res, monitoring and control functions as well
as special designs for use under extreme con-
ditions. They are all based on the standard
type fans which you will find in this catalogue.
Special fan types for your application can be
produced in economical batch sizes. Our
expert engineers will assist you in selecting
the right configuration.
Innovation at its best:
Vario-Pro® with “intelligence inside”. Its pro-
grammed intelligence thanks to customer-spe-
cifically configured software modules makes
the cooling of electronics even more economi-
cal and flexible. For example, temperature-
dependent speed profiles are possible with a
number of freely selectable interpolation
points. External speed settings and a variety of
combinable alarm and tachometer functions
can also be programmed. The digital motor
management achieves high control accuracy.
Practice-oriented: Fans – customised and intelligent

11
Higher protection class for every type of application
ebm-papst provides, on request, many fan series in versions which
conform to the requirements of Protection Class IP 54: Their stator and
all electrical components are fully encapsulated. Stainless steel ball
bearings can be used for operation in particularly aggressive media
and use under extreme environmental conditions, thus providing addi-
tional reliability.
Virtually everything is possible
Regardless of your cooling and ventilation tasks, we develop the right
solution and what is more, the most economical one. Based on the fans
listed in this catalogue, well over 4000 different versions are available.
Temperature-controlled fans
Fans with temperature-controlled speed have particularly quiet cooling
characteristics. Thanks to integrated IC technology, they adapt their
speed to the current cooling requirements, which results in a drastic
reduction of noise in most operating modes. A temperature sensor pro-
vides the fan with thermal information: either externally via a single
lead or integrated into the hub of the fan.
Speed setting via interfaces
With a wide range of DC fans with separate control input, ebm-papst
provides an alternative to the NTC-controlled types of fans. They are
especially suitable for systems and units which already have standard
interfaces for varying speed via internal switching and control circuits.
The main applications are units which demand load-dependent individ-
ual speed profiles or systems with stand-by minimum cooling require-
ments and varied speed increase at varying power peaks.
“Electronic tachometer”
thanks to sensor signal
Do you wish to be informed about the current
fan speed at all times? ebm-papst has fans
with an integrated “electronic tachometer”
which registers the actual value of the fan
speed. Via an integrated sensor, the fan gen-
erates speed-dependent signals which can be
directly utilised. Depending on the number of
poles of the motor, 2, 3 or 6 pulses per revo-
lution are generated.
Alarm signal for more safety
If your application requires monitored fan
operation, in addition to speed monitoring,
ebm-papst also provides a multitude of
varying alarm signals. Depending on the type
of fan in question, the signal is either static,
already evaluated or interface-compatible.
The alarm signal output provides reliable
longterm monitoring and a status signal if
critical operating conditions evolve.
S-Force
The new measure of things!
When you need to provide extremely fast,
powerful and efficient cooling for electronic
components of all kinds, the generation of
S-Force high-performance fans finishes first:
in air performance, pressure build-up and
technology. Extremely efficient drives and
optimised aerodynamics form the core tech-
nology of the S-Force fans, which we offer in
both an axial and brand-new centrifugal
model.

Types of fans and their function
Axial fans:
High air flow with medium to relatively high pressure build-up
The air flow in axial fans, whose impeller is similar to that of a propeller, is conducted to a great
extent parallel to the axis of rotation, in other words in the axial direction. Axial fans with free air
delivery at zero static pressure have the lowest power input that rises with increasing back
pressure. Axial fans for cooling of electronic equipment are mostly equipped with external hous-
ing and an electric motor integrated into the fan hub. This compact design allows space-saving
accommodation of all devices; the flange is equipped with mounting holes.
Diagonal fans:
High flow rate at relatively high pressure build-up
At first glance diagonal fans only differ slightly from axial fans. Intake is axial, whereas exhaust
is diagonal. Due to the conical shape of the wheel and housing, the air is pressurised more. In
direct comparison with axial fans of the same size and comparable performance, these fans are
distinguished by the lower operating noise at high pressures.
Centrifugal fans:
High pressure build-up at limited flow rate
Many of the cooling problems that occur can be optimally solved by axial and/or diagonal fans.
If, for example, the required cooling air has to be conducted at an angle of 90° or if even high
pressure is necessary, centrifugal fans are more effective. For your application, ebm-papst
offers not only complete centrifugal fans but also motor/impeller combinations without external
housing.
Tangential fans:
High flow rate at low pressure
Tangential fans are used above all-, for large-surface air flow in devices. The air flows through
the roller-shaped impellers twice in the radial direction: in the intake area from the outside to
the inside and in the outflow area from the inside to the outside. Whirls form in the roller due to
the vanes which guarantee a steady flow of air through the impeller.

• Read down from this point to obtain the
required value for the cooling air flow.
The diagram is based on
the following formula:
4. Optimum operating range
The required fan, however, must also be able
to deliver a suitable static pressure increase
Δpf, in order to force the cooling air through
the device. A fan must therefore be selected
that provides the required air flow performance
within its optimum operating range (see also
the air performance curves under technical
data).
5. Fan selection
If the requirements of an application are ful-
filled by more than one fan, the noise level,
space requirements, economy and ambient
conditions will assist in making the final choice.

Selecting the correct fan
1. Dissipated energy
A large amount of the energy consumed by electrical and electronic
devices is converted into heat. In selecting the correct fan, therefore,
it is important to determine the dissipated energy that must be remo-
ved. The electrical power consumption of the unit to be cooled, often
represents a suitable value for this purpose.
2. Permissible temperature rise
The air flow which the selected fan is required to generate, is deter-
mined by the dissipated energy and the permissible rise (ΔT) of the
cooling air flow (from entry to exit of the device to be cooled). The
max. allowable ΔT depends greatly on the temperature sensitivity of
the individual device components. ΔT = 5K means e.g. that the avera-
ge air flow leaving the device to be cooled may only be 5°C warmer
than the ambient temperature (a large volume of air is required for this
purpose). A lower air flow rate is sufficient if a higher temperature dif-
ference (e.g. ΔT = 20K), can be tolerated.
3. Required cooling air flow
• In the below diagram a horizontal line is drawn from the dissipated
enery to intersect with the selected ΔT line.

Fan installation
Information on installation
When a fan is operated for the first time in an application, the user may
have noticed that the flow rate in the device was lower than expected.
What is the reason for this?
• The values stated in this catalogue were determined under optimum,
constant and comparable measurement conditions.
• Ideal mounting conditions under which free air intake and exhaust
are present are seldom feasible in practice. Quite frequently the fans
must be mounted in close proximity to other components or cabinet
panels. As a consequence, the intake and exhaust currents may be
restricted, causing the air flow to diminish and the noise level to
increase. Fans are particularly sensitive to obstructions which are
positioned directly in front of the output cross section as they often
cause an increase in tonal noise.
Our advice: The distance between the fan and adjacent components
should be at least equal to the installation depth of the fan.
Intake or exhaust side installation
Under ideal conditions, the operating point is
represented as the intersection between the
fan and loss curves, regardless of whether the
fan is positioned at the air intake or exhaust
side of the device. In addition to ensuring the
required flow rate, several additional aspects
must be considered for determining an appro-
priate fan concept.
The intake air currents of a fan are mainly
laminar, comprising nearly the entire suction
area. By contrast, the exhaust air of a fan is
generally turbulent, while it flows on a pre-
ferred direction, e.g. axial for an axial fan. The
turbulences of the exhaust intensify the heat
transfer from components within the air cur-
rents, so that mounting the fan at the air
intake side of the device is recommended for
cooling and heating. Mounting the fan at the
device intake is also advantageous because
the fan will not be subjected to the dissipated
heat of the device. Therefore, it operates at
low ambient temperatures and has a higher
life expectancy.

Accident prevention
The turning rotor and the high speeds that
are sometimes involved mean that our fan
products carry an inherent risk of injury.
They may only be operated after correct
installation and with suitable protective
facilities (e.g. with a guard grille). More
information can be found in the internet at:

Service life
Service life L10 (40°C) and L10 (Tmax)
The values given in the first two columns have been derived from intensive, in-house service life
endurance tests, in which our products are operated in various positions at 40°C and 70°C until
they fail. A fan is deemed to have failed when it deviates from its defined air flow and speed
values, or when the operating noise becomes noticeable. Such tests can take several years
before a representative number of failures have been registered, and even today, some fans are
still in the process of endurance testing, even though they began tests in the 1980s. These fans
are proof of the legendary reliability of fans from the Black Forest.
Test results are presented in a diagram and the service life of the product L10 at the temperatu-
re tested is determined on the basis of the Weibull distribution.
These tests have given us years of experience in the way various design parameters and tem-
peratures can affect the service life of a product. Data for service life at various temperatures
for new products can be stated with a very high degree of precision on the basis of tests, pro-
duct specifications and of commonalities in the design of the product.
New: Life expectancy L10Δ (40°C)
The new third service life column states the expected service life L10Δ. This value is based on
the calculation methods conventionally applied in the compact fan market. Again here, the foun-
dations for the service life values are our service life endurance tests at high ambient tempera-
tures. The service life at temperatures below the test temperatures is calculated using fixed fac-
tors. This method produces much higher service life values, especially at room temperature (see
diagram on right).
Summary:
The life span calculations have been carried out to the best of our knowledge and are based on
experience gained by ebm-papst. The specified L10 (40°C), L10 (Tmax) and L10Δ (40°C) values
all allow statements to be made about the theoretical calculated service life under certain
assumptions. The values determined here are extrapolations from our own service life tests and
from statistical variables. In the respective customer applications, different influences may occur
which cannot be included in the calculations due to their complexity. The service life information
is explicitly not a guarantee of service life, but strictly a theoretical quality figure.

Definitions
Nominal voltage (Volts)
The voltage at which the nominal values (the ta-
bular values listed in this catalogue) were deter-
mined. The fan operation for DC fans is not lim-
ited to the nominal voltage. Fan speed and fan
performance can vary according to the permis-
sible voltage range that is specified on the
nameplate of each fan.
Frequency (Hz)
ebm-papst AC fans are made for operating fre-
quencies of 50 Hz or 60 Hz. Their technical data
alter accordingly.
Air flow (m3/h)
The air performance of the fan in free air opera-
tion, i.e. the fan blows into the free space with-
out static pressure build-up.
Fan curves
The fan curves are determined in accordance
with DIN 24 163 specifications on a dual-cham-
ber test stand with intake-side measurement.
This measurement technique closely approxi-
mates the operating conditions experienced in
typical applications for fans and yields realistic
performance curves. The curves apply to an air
density of ρ = 1.2 kg/m3, corresponding to an
air pressure of 1013 mbar at 20 °C. Variations in
air density affect pressure generation but not
the flow rate. The pressure generated at other
air densities may be estimated with the formula
Δρ2 = Δρ1 (ρ2 / ρ1).
The nominal speed values, air flow and power
input listed in the table were measured in free
air operation with horizontal shaft at an ambient
temperature of 20 +5 °C, air density
ρ = 1.2 kg/m3 after a warm-up period of 5 min.
Optimum operating range
During operation, fans are required to produce
an air flow with a simultaneous increase of
pressure. These operating conditions are
described in the section “Optimum Operating
Range”. The optimum operating range is there-
fore always indicated in this catalogue in the
shaded area. In this range the fans operate best
with respect to efficiency and noise level. Within
this optimum operating range the noise level
only fluctuates insignificantly.
Noise [dB(A), Bel(A)]
1. Sound pressure level – dB(A)
Noise ratings of the fan in free air operation, i.e.
at maximum flow rate.
2. Sound power level – Bel(A) / dB(A)
Extent of the overall sound radiation of the fan.
The sound power level is determined in the
optimum operating range.
PAPST Sintec® sleeve bearings

excellent qualities:
– Very precise, large sintered bearings
– Low running noise
– High service life expectancy
– Insensitive to shock and vibration
Ball bearings
Precision ball bearings for particularly high
ambient temperatures and high service life
expectancy.
Power input (Watts)
Input performance of the fan motor when
operating at nominal voltage. Depending on the
operating condition in the application, the power
input may be higher.
Temperature range (°C)
The permissible ambient temperature range
within which the fan can be expected to run
continuously.

DC fans 
Range of fans
ebm-papst offers you the widest full product
line of DC axial and diagonal fans: From 25 mm
to 280 mm in size. Every single type of fan can
be optimally integrated in the respective device
concept. The highly  
economical brushless motor
technology of these fans provides a  
unique
variety of intelligent innovations that can be
realised today at prices that would have been
unthinkable just a few years ago. 
Electronic protection against
reverse polarity
ebm-papst DC fans have electronically commu-
tated drives with electronic protection against
reverse polarity.The electronics are conveniently
located in the fan hub. 
Product life expectancy
A distinctive feature of DC fan technology is 
the convincingly high product life expectancy.
Thanks to the excellent efficiency of the brush-
less drives, the thermal load of the bear 
ings is
reduced, thus con 
siderably increasing the life
expectancy of the fans.
Protection class
DC fans with sleeve and ball  
bearings are  
pow-
ered by Class E insulated motors. All ebm-papst
fans conform to the requirements of  
protection
class IP 20. Fans conforming to IP 54 and spe-
cial protection classes are also avail 
able. 
Voltage range
Many of our DC fans can be operated on volta-
ges that are up to 50% lower and 25% higher
than their nominal voltage (see Voltage range in
the technical tables). This enables the air per-
formance to be adapted to the cooling require-
ments and allows the noise to be reduced, even
if the fan does not have a control input.
Closed-loop speed control and monitoring 
Closed-loop speed control and function monito-
ring are becoming increasingly important in
many applications. ebm-papst offers many fans
in the standard design with a control input and
open collector speed signal.
S-Force 
The new S-Force fans with their extremely high
blower capacity of up to 950 m3/h and pressu-
re build-up of up to 1200 pascals are capable
of dealing with the extreme heat load. If nee-
ded, these fans can produce up to 100% more
output under full load and they work with a
much broader delivery bandwidth than current
models. This makes them ideal for equipment
and systems with a high density of compo-
nents. Thanks to intelligent motor features, they
can be individually adapted for any application.
S-Force fans are available in 5 standard dimen-
sions.

Special features of S-Force fans
The S-Force series is the most powerful product series on the market. S-Force stands for the highest innovation in motor technology, fluid mecha-
nics and electronics.  The one-of-a-kind power density of the products requires special attention to the application at the customer's facility.
Service life
Due to the high currents in the fans, the load on the electrolyte capaci-
tors is greater, which reduces the service life of the capacitor. As a lar-
ger or additional capacitor cannot be housed in the fan, the capacitor
must be housed in the supply line.
If the power pack of the application has a corresponding capacitor, in
some cases it may be possible to omit the external capacitor.
Recommended capacitors
We recommend using the following capacitors from Rubycon:
24 VDC:
50 ZL 680 μF; 12,5 mm x 30 mm or 
50 ZLH 680 μF 12,5 mm x 30 mm
48 VDC:
100 YXG 470 μF; 16 mm x 35,5 mm or
100 ZLH 470  μF 16 mm x 31,5 mm
Other capacitors with equal or greater capacitance and equal or lower
serial resistance can also be used.
ebm-papst St. Georgen offers the following capacitors ex stock:
24 VDC: 1000 μF / 50 V, 16 mm x 25 mm
Art. No.: 992 0345 000 (LZ 354)
48 VDC: 680 μF / 100 V, 18 mm x 40 mm
Art. No. : 992 0355 000 (LZ 355)

DC fans
Product line
Our centrifugal product line includes fans for
every application. Whether as free-running
impellers with a diameter between 97 mm and
225 mm or as assemblies in a ready-to-install,
compact housing with inlet nozzle with an edge
length between 51 mm and 270 mm. Of cour-
se, all models feature high-efficiency, brushless
motor technology.
Electronic protection against
reverse polarity
ebm-papst DC fans have electronically commu-
tated drives with electronic protection against
reverse polarity.The electronics are conveniently
located in the fan hub.
Product life expectancy
A distinctive feature of DC fan technology is
the convincingly high product life expectancy.
Thanks to the excellent efficiency of the brush-
less drives, the thermal load of the bearings is
reduced, thus considerably increasing the life
expectancy of the fans.
Protection class
DC fans with sleeve and ball bearings are pow-
ered by Class E insulated motors. All ebm-papst
fans conform to the requirements of Protection
Class IP 20. Fans conforming to IP 54 and spe-
cial protection classes are also available.
Voltage range
Many of our DC fans can be operated on volta-
ges that are up to 50% lower and 25% higher
than their nominal voltage (see Voltage range in
the technical tables). This enables the air per-
formance to be adapted to the cooling require-
ments and allows the noise to be reduced, even
if the fan does not have a control input.
Closed-loop speed control and monitoring
Closed-loop speed control and function monito-
ring are becoming increasingly important in
many applications. ebm-papst offers many fans
in the standard design with a control input and
open collector speed signal.
S-Force centrifugal – RadiCal
The new S-Force centrifugal fans provide peak
performance among fans of this type. With air
flow capacity at over 1500 m³/h and a pressure
build-up of up to 1000 pascals, the highest heat
flows are manageable. In addition, the models
are extremely efficient due to the multi-pole,
electronically commutated drive motors and can
be adapted individually to every application
thanks to intelligent motor features. Some
models use our new, highly efficient RadiCal
impellers.

Cooling capacity and efficiency
Greater power density, increasing miniaturisation and extreme electronic
component density are posing increased demands on the cooling capacity
and efficiency of fans. The intelligent and space-saving integration of the
fan in the device configuration is therefore of major importance:
• Tailor-made cooling adapted to the situation as and when required.
• Programmable cooling by defining speed profiles.
• Transparency of function thanks to complete, interactive monitoring in
all operating conditions.
ebm-papst provides intelligent cooling concepts which are optimally
adapted to requirements. For example:
1. Speed adaptation via NTC sensor
Standard fans in electronics cooling– tried and tested by the millions and
nevertheless a temporary solution, because standard fans have a distinct
disadvantage: With constant speed and a corresponding high noise factor,
they continuously provide the air flow required in extreme cases. This
extreme case only occurs-, if it occurs at all-, for a fraction of the service
life. What is needed is an intelligent fan that automatically adapts to the
current cooling requirements.
The ebm-papst answer: A complete range of DC
fans with temperature-controlled speed adapta-
tion - in all standard dimensions.
Installation is simple. The control electronics
receive their thermal information for speed
adaptation steplessly and loss-free via a tem-
perature sensor either externally via a single
lead, positioned as required, or internally direct-
ly in the fan hub in the air flow.
2. DC fans with separate control input
Open or closed-loop speed control is also possi-
ble with DC fans that have a separate control
input. A variation in speed can thus be imple-
mented via a control voltage or a pulse-width
modulated signal. These possibilities are used
primarily in devices that have appropriate stan-
dard interfaces and thus require a load-depend-
ent variation of the fans.

PWM
3. Sensor signal
DC fans with sensor signal.
The integrated „electronic tachometer“ continu-
ously provides an actual speed signal for exter-
nal evaluation. The user is informed at all times
of the current fan speed via an extremely sim-
ple signal evaluation on the customer side. The
sensor signal is via a separate lead.
4. Alarm signal
For applications which require monitored fan
operation with alarm signal, ebm-papst has
numerous alarm signal versions, either a static,
pre-processed or interface-compatible high or
low continuous signal depending on the type of
fan.
5. Turbo drives
Fans with three-phase EC drives and micro-
processor-controlled motor electronics. These
three-phase motors whose torque is virtually
non-reliant on the rotor position are used for
extremely high running smoothness. The speed
of these fans can be controlled over a very wide
range with PWM, analogue voltage or tempera-
ture. Optionally, the fans can be supplied with
reversible direction of rotation and active brake
operation.
6. Vario-Pro fans
This high-end fan concept by ebmpapst with pro-
grammed intelligence and customer-specific inte-
grated functions makes your electronics cooling
even more versatile and competitive. Vario-Pro
ensures a fresh economic breeze for all demanding
cooling tasks – e.g. where greater reliability, more
flexibility and intelligent function features such as
alarm function, speed control etc. are required.
The successful concept of Vario-Pro is: Tailor-made
software instead of fixed hardware, because pro-
grammed software modules for motor control and
application intelligence are responsible for the
work that analogue components were responsible
for in the past. This central control unit of the
Vario-Pro comprises a microcontroller and an
EEPROM, on which all characteristics are stored.
7. Protection against environmental
influences
Some applications place particular demands on the
fans' resistance to ambient influences, such as
dust, moisture, water and salt. ebm-papst offer
solutions for adapting fans to these ambient condi-
tions.

Progress made by ebm-papst
The best example: The ACmaxx fans from ebm-papst, which, thanks to an
ingenious yet simple improvement over conventional AC fans, provide
substantial benefits.
The aim in developing the new ACmaxx series was to raise the technology
standard of the conventional AC fan significantly and, in the process, facil-
itate the transition to the new technology by retaining the overall mount-
ing dimensions. In short, to ensure the fans can be replaced 1:1 without
any peripheral changes or changes to the voltage situation.
ebm-papst offers two generations of ACmaxx products that meet different
needs.
Long service life
The efficiency of ACmaxx and i-maxx motors is up to 75% higher than that
of conventional AC fan variants. This not only saves energy, it also means
less intrinsic heating in the motor. The reduced heating has a direct, positi-
ve effect on the bearing system, which is why the fans have a service life
that is up to 85% longer! This also lengthens the service and maintenance
intervals significantly. The expense of replacement fans, and even more
expensive downtimes, are kept to a manageable minimum.

What ACmaxx and i-maxx have in common:
Energy efficiency
The drive concept is based on state-of-the-art GreenTech EC technology
with outstanding motor efficiency. Compared to AC fans of the same size,
ACmaxx energy consumption is up to 77% lower–for higher cooling capa-
city! The energy balance alone means that the products pay for themsel-
ves after only a few months. The savings over the entire service life, espe-
cially in systems with multiple fans, is considerable.

Independent of mains frequency and mains voltage
The ACmaxx and i-maxx fans are prepared for direct connection to all AC
voltages and frequencies. The speed, and thus important properties of the
fan such as air flow and noise, are independent of the power frequency
and do not change, even within the defined voltage range. Voltage fluctua-
tions in the power system are automatically compensated for.

Safety
• Safety certifications: UL, CSA and VDE 0805 / EN60950.
VDE 0700 / EN60335 on request.
• Our fans have the CE mark of conformity.
• EMC protection:
> EN61000-4-4 Level 1 (1 kV or 2 kV)B
> EN61000-4-2 Level 8 kV/15 kV or 4 kV/8 kV

Ambient influences
AC fans are extremely common and are used in a wide variety of applica-
tions. In control cabinet cooling, beer coolers, cooling cabinets, wood-bur-
ning stoves, medical devices – all have different requirements for resi-
stance to ambient influences. ACmaxx and i-maxx fans offer the same
features for protection against moisture, splash water and rough ambient
conditions.
Particular design features of the i-maxx (ACi 4400):
i-maxx is more compact!
As large as existing AC fans – and not a bit larger. This is the most out-
standing feature of the new i-maxx ACi 4400. Even in the hub area, the
fan does not differ from typical 119x119x38 mm AC fans. Out with the
AC, in with the i-maxx ACi 4400 – it's that simple.
i-maxx is more efficient!
ACmaxx saves energy, and the i-maxx generation saves even more. While
an AC fan at 50 Hz can barely reach an overall efficiency of 5-6%, the
ACmaxx makes it to approx. 20-25%. With the new i-maxx ACi 4400, a
remarkable level of up to 30% is reached. This is the result of the optimi-
sation of the entire package made up of drive, electronics, AC/DC conver-
sion and aerodynamics. Thus the new i-maxx series boasts energy savings
of almost 75% compared to the corresponding AC fan, thus providing signi-
ficantly higher savings than the 40% level of the old AC 4300 generation.

i-maxx is quieter!
The i-maxx ACi 4400 is quieter! Quieter than AC fans and quieter than the
existing ACmaxx generation. The reason for this is the optimised aerody-
namics and the drive, which is optimised for minimum structure-borne
noise. Thus the fan is only half as loud at comparable air performance,
and is up to 6 dB(A) quieter at some operating points.
Speed independent of voltage and frequency
For the i-maxx ACi 4400, the speed, and thus the air flow and operating
noise, are independent of the supply voltage and power frequency.
Versions are available for 115 VAC with a voltage range from 85 to 132
VAC and 230 VAC with a voltage range of 195 to 265 VAC. Voltage fluctua-
tions and frequency differences in the power system are compensated for
automatically.

Technical information
Particular design features of the ACmaxx:
Prepared for all AC voltages
These models have a very wide voltage range from 85 to 265 VAC – the
global voltage range, so to speak. This enables the fan to be used around
the world, opening up large savings potentials. In addition to reduced logi-
stics effort and stock-keeping, worldwide availability is key. ACmaxx is
compatible with every supply voltage–no switching needed. From 85 to
265 volts and mains frequencies of 50 and 60 hertz. Voltage fluctuations
in the power system are automatically compensated for.
Higher performance
Unlike conventional AC technology, the state-of-the-art drive concept of
this fan series is not linked to a fixed power frequency. This allows the
motor speed to be increased over a wide range. Thus ACmaxx provides
significantly higher air flow and significantly increased pressure.

Information on pictograms
Speed signal
The fan uses a separate wire to output information
about its speed, and thus about the speed of the rotor.
For technical details, please refer to page 110.
On the pages of the catalogue and on the following overview pages, the pictograms illustrated below provide information about technically possi-
ble special versions in the fan line presented.
Please note that these special versions are not possible for all voltages and speeds, and not in all combinations.
The special versions are designed for specific customers and projects and are not usually available off the shelf.
Go / No-go alarm
The fan uses a separate wire to output a static signal
when it is stationary, thus providing information about
whether or not the rotor is turning. For technical
details, please refer to page 117.
Alarm with limit speed
If the speed drops below a certain level defined in the
fan's electronics, the fan will emit a static signal, thus
providing information about whether or not the rotor is
turning. For technical details, please refer to page 114.
External temperature sensor
An NTC is connected to the fan via a separate wire and
the fan changes its speed depending on the temperatu-
re at the NTC. For technical details, please refer to
page 120.
Internal temperature sensor
In this case, the NTC is integrated into the fan and the
fan changes its speed depending on the temperature at
the NTC. For technical details, please refer to page
120.
PWM control input
The speed of the fan can be changed via a pulse-width-
modulated signal. This signal is applied to a specially
provided wire. For technical details, please refer to page
121.
Analogue control input
The speed of the fan can be changed via a control volta-
ge. This control voltage is applied to a specially provided
wire. For technical details, please refer to page 121.

AC fans
Product line
The renowned ebm-papst AC fans are used
when DC voltage is not available. The AC range
of fans is based on experience gained from
decades of development activity, millions of
units in series production and competence in
innovation of a world-wide technological leader.
A wide range of fans for AC operation is pre-
sented in this catalogue. In addition to complete
device fans, you will also find fans without
external housing, providing a particularly eco-
nomical advantage when the air duct can be
integrated in the respective device.
Variety of sizes
AC fans are available in a variety of sizes with
either air exhaust or air intake over struts.
Silent running models with sleeve bearings or
for extreme ambient conditions; fans with ball
bearings are available with plug connection or
external leads.
Shaded-pole or capacitor motors
Fan drives by shaded-pole or capacitor motors,
most of which incorporate the world-famous
ebm-papst external rotor principle: The fan
blades are directly attached to the external rotor
of the external rotor motor, thus combining both
high performance and profitability.
Flat built AC fans
ebm-papst also has particularly flat built AC
fans with internal rotor motor. Their advantage:
quick start to full speed. A plastic impeller and
the both smaller and lighter internal rotor motor
lead to a lower moment of inertia.
Bearings
AC fans with sleeve bearings are powered by
Class E insulated motors. Fans with ball
bearings are equipped with Class B, E or F
insulated motors.
Protection class
All ebm-papst fans conform to the requirements
of IP 20. Fans conforming to IP 54 and special
types of protection class are also available.
AC voltage
The line of AC fans for Euro voltage according
to IEC 60038 (230 V + 6 %, -10 %) is basically
also available for 115 V.
Frequencies
AC fans can be operated at frequencies of 50
Hz or 60 Hz. However, their technical data then
changes accordingly.
Capacitor
Fans driven by capacitor external motors
provide particularly high operating efficiency.
Generally, the required operating capacitor is
already integrated in the fan housing.
Overloading
Almost all AC fans are protected against over-
loading (e.g. due to locked rotor) the drive
motors are either impedance protected (marked
“Impedance protected”, and/or “Z.P.”) or are
equipped with a thermal switch (marked
“Thermally protected” or “Th.P.”). The model
designation of these fans ends with “S”.

The air flow and noise level of fans without external hou-
sing depends on the installation conditions. The stated air
flow and noise has been measured with an orifice 76.5
mm Ø at a distance of approx. 17 mm from the mounting
bracket. Under exceptionally favourable mounting condi-
tions, the air flow of fan series 8000 A is achievable. The
noise in the optimal operating range can only be measured
for these fans in a specific application.

The air flow and noise level of fans without external hou-
sing depends on the installation conditions. The stated
air flow and noise has been measured with an orifice
109 mm Ø at a distance of approx. 17 mm from the
mounting bracket. Under exceptionally favourable
mounting conditions, the air flow of fan series 4600 N
is achievable. The noise in the optimal operating range
can only be measured for these fans in a specific appli-
cation.

AC fans
Product line
The renowned ebm-papst AC fans are used
when DC voltage is not available. The AC range
of fans is based on experience gained from
decades of development activity, millions of
units in series production and competence in
innovation of a world-wide technological leader.
A wide range of fans for AC operation is pre-
sented in this catalogue. In addition to complete
device fans, you will also find fans without
external housing, providing a particularly eco-
nomical advantage when the air duct can be
integrated in the respective device.
Variety of sizes
AC fans are available in a variety of sizes with
either air exhaust or air intake over struts.
Silent running models with sleeve bearings or
for extreme ambient conditions; fans with ball
bearings are available with plug connection or
external leads.
Shaded-pole or capacitor motors
Fan drives by shaded-pole or capacitor motors,
most of which incorporate the world-famous
ebm-papst external rotor principle: The fan
blades are directly attached to the external rotor
of the external rotor motor, thus combining both
high performance and profitability.
Flat built AC fans
ebm-papst also has particularly flat built AC
fans with internal rotor motor. Their advantage:
quick start to full speed. A plastic impeller and
the both smaller and lighter internal rotor motor
lead to a lower moment of inertia.
Bearings
AC fans with sleeve bearings are powered by
Class E insulated motors. Fans with ball
bearings are equipped with Class B, E or F
insulated motors.
Protection class
All ebm-papst fans conform to the requirements
of IP 20. Fans conforming to IP 54 and special
types of protection class are also available.
AC voltage
The line of AC fans for Euro voltage according
to IEC 60038 (230 V + 6 %, -10 %) is basically
also available for 115 V.
Frequencies
AC fans can be operated at frequencies of 50
Hz or 60 Hz. However, their technical data then
change accordingly.
Capacitor
Fans driven by capacitor external motors
provide particularly high operating efficiency.
Generally, the required operating capacitor is
already integrated in the fan housing.
Overloading
Almost all AC fans are protected against over-
loading (e.g. due to locked rotor) the drive
motors are either impedance protected (marked
“Impedance protected”, and/or “Z.P.”) or are
equipped with a thermal switch (marked
“Thermally protected” or “Th.P.”). The model
designation of these fans ends with “S”.

HOW 10 USE CAPACITORS FOR MULTI-SPEED BLOWERS 
It is possible to make any ebm blower with a PSC 
motor a multi­
speed blower by adding a second or third capacitor on the load line 
(blue) at or near the value of the motor run capacitor. Actual capacitor 
value and RPM achieved are dependent on the nature of each 
application.

HOW 10 USE CAPACITORS FOR MULTI-SPEED BLOWERS 
It is possible to make any ebm blower with a PSC 
motor a multi­
speed blower by adding a second or third capacitor on the load line 
(blue) at or near the value of the motor run capacitor. Actual capacitor 
value and RPM achieved are dependent on the nature of each 
application.

HOW 10 USE CAPACITORS FOR MULTI-SPEED BLOWERS 
It is possible to make any ebm blower with a PSC 
motor a multi­
speed blower by adding a second or third capacitor on the load line 
(blue) at or near the value of the motor run capacitor. Actual capacitor 
value and RPM achieved are dependent on the nature of each 
application.

HOW 10 USE CAPACITORS FOR MULTI-SPEED BLOWERS 
It is possible to make any ebm blower with a PSC 
motor a multi­
speed blower by adding a second or third capacitor on the load line 
(blue) at or near the value of the motor run capacitor. Actual capacitor 
value and RPM achieved are dependent on the nature of each 
application.

HOW 10 USE CAPACITORS FOR MULTI-SPEED BLOWERS 
It is possible to make any ebm blower with a PSC 
motor a multi­
speed blower by adding a second or third capacitor on the load line 
(blue) at or near the value of the motor run capacitor. Actual capacitor 
value and RPM achieved are dependent on the nature of each 
application.

MATERIAL SUMMARY SHEET 7
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics
Molding Materials – Thermoplastics 
E-A-R’s proprietary, highly damped ISODAMP™ thermoplastic and VersaDamp™ thermoplastic molding materials are standard- 
and custom-molded to provide high performance shock, vibration and noise control.
 
As highly damped elastomers, these materials platforms exhibit extremely low rebound characteristics, ensuring very low 
amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after shock or vibration input.
Standard and custom configurations include numerous styles of isolation grommets (with or without metal inserts), bushings, 
mounting pads and feet, self-locking fan mounts, snubbers, gaskets, bumpers and pads.

HOW 10 USE CAPACITORS FOR MULTI-SPEED BLOWERS 
It is possible to make any ebm blower with a PSC 
motor a multi­
speed blower by adding a second or third capacitor on the load line 
(blue) at or near the value of the motor run capacitor. Actual capacitor 
value and RPM achieved are dependent on the nature of each 
application.

Information
Axial fans: High air flow with medium  
to relatively high pressure increase 
The air flow in axial fans with an impeller that is similar to a propeller  
is conducted largely parallel to the axis of rotation, in other words  
in the axial direction. Axial fans with free air delivery at zero static 
pressure have the lowest power input that rises with increasing back 
pressure. Axial fans for cooling of electronic equipment are mostly 
equipped with external housing. The electric motor is integrated in  
the fan hub. This compact design allows space-saving accommodation 
of all devices. The flange is equipped with mounting holes.
Diagonal fans: High air flow  
at relatively high pressure increase
At first glance diagonal fans only differ slightly from axial fans.  
Intake is axial, whereas exhaust is diagonal. Due to the conical  
shape of the wheel and housing, the air is pressurized more in the  
diagonal fan. In direct comparison with axial fans of the same size  
and comparable performance, these fans are distinguished by the  
lower operating noise at high pressures.
Centrifugal fans: High pressure  
increase at limited flow rate
Generally, many cooling tasks can be performed excellently by  
axial and/or diagonal fans. But if the cooling airflow has to be  
deflected at an angle of 90°, for example, or if even greater pressure 
increase is necessary, centrifugal fans are more effective.  
For your application, ebm-papst offers not only complete centrifugal 
fans, but also motor/impeller combinations without external housing.
Tangential fans: High air flow  
with low pressure increase
Tangential fans are used especially to produce a wide airflow  
distribution through devices. The air flows through the roller-shaped 
impellers twice in the centrifugal direction: in the intake area from the  
outside to the inside and in the outflow area from the inside to the  
outside. Whirls form in the roller due to the vanes, which guarantee  
a steady flow of air through the impeller.
Types of fans  
and their function

Compact fans for AC, DC and EC · Edition 2022-11
Drive know-how
For the past 80 years, all conceivable types and applications of  
drive engineering have played an essential role at ebm-papst.  
A commitment that is the foundation for the development of  
optimum drive solutions regardless of the type of fan and its use.  
In DC fans, ebm-papst set standards 50 years ago with the intro-
duction of DC fans with electronically commutated external rotor 
motors. In the changeover from AC fans to EC motors, ebm-papst 
is again doing pioneering work. EC motors for AC connection are 
highly efficient and impress with their long service life, higher air 
flow and significant pressure increase.
Smooth operation
Our aerodynamically optimized design and high mechanical preci-
sion produces outstanding noise properties in series production. 
The ""soft"" commutation electronics of DC and EC fans produce a 
very smooth operation. By avoiding steep switching edges when 
the individual coils are switched, this reduces the structure-borne 
noise from the motor. Computer-aided measurements and series of 
analyses performed in a state-of-the-art sound measuring chamber 
are conducted on each fan model from the very beginning.
Long service life
The bearing system plays a vital role both in the long service life 
and the smooth operation of device fans. The Sintec compact  
bearing provides most of the device fans with a proven bearing  
system. Constant low noise during the entire operating time and 
considerably lower shock sensitivity are the outstanding features  
of this bearing technology. In addition, with regard to temperature 
endurance, Sintec compact bearings can be used without problems 
in most applications.
Despite the slightly greater noise and shock sensitivity of ball bea-
rings, this bearing technology should be given preference for fans 
exposed to extreme thermal and adverse application conditions 
(e.g. extreme environmental conditions, critical installation posi­
tion, etc.). The service life data provided in this catalog is based on 
extensive service life tests and mathematically / scientifically pro-
ven service life calculations. Our product descriptions are updated 
continuously with all relevant data obtained from long-term tests.

Aerodynamics
With the aid of state-of-the-art computer programs, we are able  
to optimize the fan impellers and the inner shape of the housing. 
Air output and available motor performance are matched exactly 
to the size of fan. This guarantees the low noise that is typical for 
ebm-papst, even at high back pressure.
Sturdy construction – in metal or plastic
Fans of all-metal construction: sturdy and resistant. The housing  
is made of an aluminum alloy. The metal surfaces that are subject 
to corrosion are permanently protected by an impact- and 
abrasion­
resistant electrophoretic baked enamel. This particular 
version is very recyclable. Fans with fiberglass-reinforced plastic 
housing and impeller: Excellent stability and low weight distinguish 
this highly efficient fan design. Combinations of metal housing and 
plastic impeller combine the advantages of both types of design.

tection class 3 / protective extra-low voltage. AC fans for protection 
class 1. ebm-papst fans meet the highest requirements of electrical 
safety. All design variants feature reverse polarity and locked-rotor 
protection. We also have a wide selection of suitable fans for indus-
try-specific standards, such as those known from the railroad, refri-
geration or housing sectors. You can find more information in our 
industry-specific catalogs at ebmpapst.com.
Quality in detail
It is the important details that reveal the meaning of the words 
""made by ebm-papst"": Consistent adherence to development and 
design processes and a goal-oriented commitment to quality along 
the entire process chain are the foundation for the above-average 
service life of our fans. 100,000 hours and above are no longer an 
exception. The no-compromise ebm-papst quality assurance spans 
over all process levels – from the choice of materials and the use of 
carefully selected, certified suppliers, from the production of parts 
up to the final assembly. These details combine to result in reliable 
fan products with an aboveaverage service life.

Practical applications: fans that are customized and smart
ebm-papst has always developed customer-specific smart fans that meet the exact requirements of the application.  
In addition to the wide range of standard fan types, we offer specific fans in many sizes, performance classes  
and designs: with smart motor features, monitoring and control functions as well as special designs for use  
under extreme conditions. They are all based on the standard type fans that you will find in this catalog.  
Special fan types for your application can be produced in economical batch sizes. Our expert engineers will assist you  
in selecting the right configuration.
Innovation at its best:
Smart and customer-specific configurable solutions increase effi-
ciency and cost-effectiveness. For example, temperature-depen-
dent speed profiles are possible with a number of freely selectable 
interpolation points. External speed settings and a variety of com-
binable alarm and tachometer functions can also be programmed.
The digital motor management achieves high control accuracy.  
Bus interfaces also offer a much greater possibility of control and 
monitoring for the digital future. 
Higher degree of protection for every type of application
ebm-papst provides, on request, many fan series in versions that 
meet to the requirements of degree of protection IP 54 and IP 68: 
Their stator and all electrical components are fully encapsulated. 
Stainless steel ball bearings can be used for operation in particu­
larly aggressive media and use under extreme environmental  
conditions, thus providing additional reliability.
Almost anything is possible
Regardless of your cooling and ventilation tasks, we will develop 
the right solution. And the most economical one.  
Based on the fans listed in this catalog, more than 4000 different 
versions are available.
Temperature-controlled fans
Fans with temperature-controlled speed have particularly quiet and 
efficient cooling characteristics. Thanks to integrated intelligence, 
they adapt their speed to the current cooling requirements. 
Speed setting via interfaces
With a wide range of DC fans with separate control input,  
ebm-papst provides an alternative to the NTC-controlled types  
of fans. They are especially suitable for systems and units that  
already have standard interfaces for varying speed via internal  
switching and control circuits. The main applications are units  
that require load-dependent, individual speed profiles or systems 
with minimum standby cooling requirements and varied speed  
increase at varying power peaks.
Electronic tachometer
Do you want to be informed about the current fan speed at all 
times? ebm-papst has fans with an integrated ""electronic tacho­
meter"". It registers the actual value of the fan speed. Via an inte­
grated sensor, the fan generates speed-dependent signals that  
can be used directly. Depending on the number of poles of the  
motor, 2, 3, or 6 pulses per revolution are generated.
Alarm signal for greater safety
If your application requires monitored fan operation, in addition to 
speed monitoring, ebm-papst also provides a multitude of varying 
alarm signals. Depending on the type of fan in question, the signal 
will either be static, already evaluated, or interface-compatible.  
The alarm signal output provides reliable long-term monitoring and 
a status signal if critical operating conditions arise.

Service life L10 (40 °C)
All values in the first column are based on in-house service life en-
durance tests in which our products are operated in several opera-
ting positions at 40 °C as well as 70 °C until they fail. A fan is
deemed to have failed when it deviates from its defined air flow 
and speed values, or when the operating noise becomes noticeab-
le. Such tests can take several years before a representative num-
ber of failures has been registered. There are still some fans in the 
process of endurance testing today that came into testing in the 
early 1980s. These fans are proof of the legendary ""made by ebm-
papst"" reliability.
Test results are presented in a diagram and the service life of the 
product L10 at the temperature tested is determined based on the 
Weibull distribution. These tests have given us years of experience 
in the way various design parameters and temperatures can affect 
the service life of a product. Data for service life at various tempe-
ratures for new products can be stated with a very high degree of 
precision based on tests, product specifications, and commonalities 
in the design of the product.
Life expectancy L10IPC (40 °C)
The second service life column states the life expectancy L10IPC.  
This information is based on the international standard IPC 9591. 
Again here, the foundations for the service life values are our  
service life endurance tests at high ambient temperatures. The  
service life at temperatures below the test temperatures is calcula-
ted using fixed factors. This method produces much higher service 
life values, especially at room temperature (see diagram on right).
Summary:
The life span calculations have been carried out to the best of our
knowledge and are based on experience gained by ebm-papst.  
The specified L10 (40 °C) and L10IPC (40 °C) values all allow state­
ments to be made about the theoretical calculated service life  
under certain assumptions. The values determined here are extra­
polations from our own service life tests and from statistical vari­
ables. In the respective customer applications, there may be diffe-
rent influencing factors that cannot be included in the calculations 
due to their complexity. The service life information is explicitly not 
a guarantee of service life, but strictly a theoretical quality figure.

1. Dissipated energy
A large amount of the energy consumed by electrical and electronic
devices is converted to heat. So when selecting the correct fan,  
it is important to determine the dissipated energy that must be  
removed. The electrical power consumption of the unit to be  
cooled often represents a suitable value for this purpose.
2. Admissible temperature increase
The air flow that the selected fan is required to generate, is deter-
mined by the dissipated energy and the admissible heating (ΔT) of 
the cooling airflow (from entry to exit of the device to be cooled). 
The maximum admissible ΔT depends greatly on the temperature 
sensitivity of the individual parts of the device.
For example, ΔT = 5K means that the average cooling airflow  
leaving the device to be cooled may be only 5°C warmer than the 
ambient temperature. This requires a lot of air. A lower air flow  
rate is sufficient if a higher temperature difference (e.g. ΔT = 20K), 
can be tolerated.
3. Required cooling airflow
	
■
In the diagram below, a horizontal line is drawn from the  
dissipated energy to intersect with the selected ΔT line.
	
■
Read down from this point to obtain the required value for the 
cooling airflow. The diagram is based on the following formula: 
 
 
 
4. Fan selection
But the fan you are looking for must also be able to deliver a suit­
able static pressure increase Δpf, in order to force the cooling air  
through the device. So a fan must be selected that provides the  
required air flow performance within its operating range (see also 
the air performance curves under technical data).
5. Fan selection with multiple alternatives
If more than one fan meets your requirements, the sound level,  
power consumption, space requirements, economy, and ambient 
conditions will assist in making the final choice.

Intake or exhaust side installation
Under ideal conditions, the operating point is represented as the
intersection between the fan and loss curves, regardless of whether
the fan is positioned at the air intake or exhaust side of the device. 
In addition to ensuring the required flow rate, several other aspects 
must be considered for determining an appropriate fan concept. 
The intake air currents of a fan are mainly laminar, comprising  
nearly the entire suction area. By contrast, the exhaust air of a fan 
is generally turbulent and flows in a preferred direction, such as  
axial for an axial fan. The turbulence of the exhaust intensifies the 
heat transfer from components within the air currents, so that  
installing the fan on the air intake side of the device is recommen-
ded for cooling and heating. Installing the fan at the device intake  
is also advantageous because the fan will not be subjected to the 
dissipated heat of the device. Therefore, it operates at low ambient 
temperatures and has a greater life expectancy.
Information on installation
When a fan is operated for the first time in an application,  
the user may have noticed that the air flow in the device was  
lower than expected. What is the reason for this? 
	
■
The values stated in this catalog were determined under  
optimum, constant, and comparable measurement conditions. 
	
■
Due to manufacturing tolerances, both the speed of the  
drive motor and the geometric shape of the fan impeller  
are usually not exactly the nominal values but within defined  
tolerance ranges. 
	
■
Ideal installation conditions under which free air intake and 
exhaust are present are seldom feasible in practice.  
Quite frequently, the fans have to be installed in close proximity 
to other components or cabinet panels. As a consequence,  
the intake and exhaust currents may be restricted, causing the  
air flow to diminish and the sound level to increase. Fans are  
particularly sensitive to obstructions that are positioned directly 
in front of the output cross section, and they often cause an  
increase in tonal noise.
Our advice: The distance between the fan and adjacent compo-
nents should be at least equal to the installation depth of the fan.

Accident prevention
The turning rotor and the high speeds that are so-
metimes involved mean that our fan products carry an 
inherent risk of injury. They may only be operated after 
correct installation and with suitable protective equip-
ment (e.g. with a finger guard). More information can be

ominal voltage [volts]
The voltage at which the nominal values
(the table values listed in this catalog)  
were determined. The fan operation for  
DC fans is not limited to the nominal vol­
tage. Fan speed and fan performance can 
vary according to the admissible voltage 
range that is specified on the nameplate  
of each fan. Please note that this is not a 
pulsed or modulated DC voltage.
Frequency [Hz]
ebm-papst AC fans are made for operating
frequencies of 50 Hz or 60 Hz. Their techni-
cal data changes accordingly.
Air flow [m3/h, cfm]
The air performance of the fan in free air
operation, i.e. the fan blows into the free 
space without static pressure increase.
Fan curves
The fan curves are determined in accor­
dance with DIN ISO 5801 specifications  
on a dualchamber test stand with intake 
side measurement. This measurement 
technique closely approximates the ope­
rating conditions experienced in typical  
applications for fans and yields realistic  
performance curves. The curves apply to  
an air density of ρ =1.2 kg/m3 corresponding 
to an air pressure of 1013 mbar at 20 °C. 
Variations in air density affect pressure
generation, but not the flow rate. The  
pressure generated at other air densities 
can be estimated with the formula Δρ2 = 
Δρ1 (ρ2 / ρ1). The nominal speed values,  
air flow and power consumption listed  
in the table were measured in free air  
operation with horizontal shaft at an  
ambient temperature of 20 °C - 25 °C,  
air density ρ =1.2 kg/m3 after a warmup  
period of 5 min.
Noise [dB(A), Bel(A)] 
1. Sound pressure level – dB(A) 
Noise ratings of the fan in free air  
operation, i.e. at maximum flow rate. 
2. Sound power level 1 Bel(A) = 10 dB(A)
Extent of the overall sound radiation of the 
fan. The sound power level is determined in 
the optimum operating point, that means, 
where the fan operates optimally in terms 
of efficiency and noise.
Power consumption [watts]
Input performance of the fan motor when
operating free blowing at nominal voltage.
Depending on the operating condition in 
the application, the power consumption 
may be significantly higher.

Cooling capacity and efficiency
Greater power density, increasing miniaturization and extreme 
electronic component density are placing increased demands on 
the cooling capacity and efficiency of fans. Therefore, intelligent 
and space-saving integration of the fan in the device configuration 
is very important:
	
■
Tailor-made cooling adapted to the situation  
as and when required.
	
■Programmable cooling by defining speed profiles.
	
■
Transparency of function thanks to complete,  
interactive monitoring in all operating conditions.
Standard fans in electronics cooling have proven themselves  
a million times over. 
With a constant speed and an appropriate sound level, they  
continuously provide the air flow required for extreme cases.  
But these extreme situations occur seldom – if at all – during  
operation. What is needed is an intelligent fan that adapts auto­
matically to the level of cooling required at the time.
ebm-papst provides intelligent cooling concepts that are optimally
adapted to practical requirements. For example:
Speed adjustment via temperature sensor 
ebm-papst answers with a complete range of DC fans with  
temperaturecontrolled speed adjustment via a temperature sensor, 
available in a variety of standard dimensions.
Installation is very simple. Either an external temperature sensor  
in the form of an exposed wire that can be placed anywhere, or  
an internal sensor located directly in the fan hub in the air flow  
provides continuous and undissipated thermal information to the 
control electronics for speed adjustment. A range of temperature 
sensors can be found on page 262.
DC fans with separate control input 
Open or closed-loop speed control is also possible with DC fans 
that have a separate control input. So a control voltage or a pulse-­
width modulated signal can be used to vary the speed. These  
options are used primarily in devices that have the appropriate 
standard interfaces and require varied fans depending on the load.

Speed signal 
DC fans with speed signal.
The integrated ""electronic tachometer"" continuously provides an 
actual speed signal for external evaluation. A very simple signal 
evaluation on the customer side informs the user of the current fan 
speed at all times. The speed signal is provided by a separate wire.
Alarm signal 
For applications that require monitored fan operation with an 
alarm signal, ebm-papst offers a number of alarm signals variants. 
Depending on the type of fan in question, the signal will either be 
static, already evaluated, or a continuous, interface-compatible, 
high or low signal. The alarm signal is provided by a separate wire.
Powerful GreenTech motor 
Fans with three-phase EC drives and microprocessor-controlled 
motor electronics. The torque of these three-phase motors,  
which is virtually independent of the rotor position, allows the fan 
to run very smoothly. The speed of these fans can be controlled 
over a very wide speed range by means of PWM, analog voltage,  
or temperature. Optionally, the fans can be supplied with reversible 
direction of rotation and active brake operation.
Robust over the long term 
Our fan solutions offer maximum operational reliability even in 
harsh ambient conditions and are extremely durable. They with-
stand temperature changes, high humidity levels and UV light.  
We can say this with confidence because we subject each of our  
solutions to the following voluntary, extremely demanding tests:
	
■Shock and vibration test
	
■Corrosion test
	
■Highly accelerated life test (HALT)
	
■Temperature change rain test
	
■EMC test

DC axial fans
FanCheck
R4R Ready for Restart
FanCheck is a diagnostic tool integrated into the fan  
electronics for determining the remaining service life  
of the fan, dependant, upon temperature, speed, and 
preset environmental parameters.
The FanCheck system emits a pulse width modulated
signal, which reflects the remaining service life of the fan. 
The pulse width is proportional to the remaining service 
life of the fan. The FanCheck signal has a pulse width of 
10 % at the end of the service life and a pulse width of  
90 % with full service life.
Basic data, such as the ball bearing system, bearing  
lubrication or lubricant used, are programmed in advance 
as parameters into the software.
The customer defines the environmental conditions,  
such as the use of fans in moist, dusty, or dirty environ-
ments; other parameters such as ambient temperature 
and speed are determined continuously. Based on all the 
influencing parameters, the software can, by means of
a complex algorithm, calculate the remaining service life 
for each individual fan.
Functionality
End of Life Indication
 
Output via alarm, PWM, analog or digital signal
IT equipment such as servers, routers, and in-row cooling 
applications must be 100% operational. For this reason, 
maintenance work is often carried out during operation.
If a single fan or a plug-in unit with several fans is taken 
out of service for this purpose, this can create a tricky  
situation: The remaining fans must provide adequate  
air flow. As a result of this and the back pressure of appli-
cations, air flows through the fan taken out of service and 
it is driven by an external source, as with a wind turbine.
The problem is that when driven by an external source, 
these speeds can amount to several thousand revolutions 
per minute and in the opposite direction of rotation.
R4R manages a feat of strength: Thanks to high-torque
motors and state-of-the-art electronics, it still guarantees 
a proper start-up process, enabling efficient and fast  
system maintenance, including the replacement of fans 
while the system is running.

Moisture protection
A coat of paint over the motor and circuit board protect the fans 
against spray water and condensation.
Degree of protection IP 54 / IP 68*
In the degree of protection IP 54, the motor and circuit boards  
are coated and therefore protected against spray water and  
moisture. The degree of protection IP 68 is important for  
ebm-papst products, as it ensures a high degree of protection  
for the encapsulated motor and electronics against foreign bodies 
and water, while protecting the user against potential hazards  
upon contact. Degrees of protection higher than IP 68 are possible 
on request. 
In addition, the IP68 protection enables ATEX certification  
according to DIN EN 60 079-7 (Group 2A, T4) for use in explosive 
atmospheres according to the certified protection class and  
resistance to salt spray.
* IP = International degree of protection marking
For AC- and EC-fans max. IP 65 available.
Salt spray protection
Salt spray represents one of the most difficult requirements for 
product durability. ebm-papst has the technology to protect fans 
and blowers from salt spray reliably and for the long term.
Stainless steel bearings
Special bearings made of stainless steel provide additional  
protection.
Solutions that are available and are used may differ depending on 
the fan size. We would be glad to develop solutions tailored to the 
demands of your application.

GreenTech EC axial fans
Product overview
EC axial compact fans, in particular our new AxiACi series, stand for flexibility,  
high efficiency and enable a wide range of applications.
 
 
The wide voltage possible in EC axial compact fans reduces the logistics costs and warehousing,  
as the fan, regardless of the line voltage, can be used with its specified values: without switching,  
the EC axial fan adapts to every power supply – from 90 to 264 VAC at line frequencies of 50 and 60 Hz. 
Voltage fluctuations in the power system are automatically compensated for.
Unlike conventional AC technology, the state-of-the-art drive concept of this fan series is  
not linked to a fixed power frequency. EC axial compact fans therefore offer a significantly  
higher air flow and a significant pressure increase.
The extremely quiet and highly efficient motor impresses with its long service life  
and is equally suit­
able for use in technologically demanding new projects and as a replacement  
for obsolete AC solutions.

Progress made by ebm-papst.
The best example: Greentech EC axial fans from ebm-papst. 
Our latest fans in the AxiACi series stand for flexibility, high  
efficiency and enable a wide range of applications ranging from 
cooling and ICT applications to switch cabinet cooling. The best – 
all in the same dimensions as conventional AC fans. The extremely 
quiet and highly efficient motor impresses with its long service life 
and is the perfect replacement for obsolete AC solutions in particu-
lar. The wide voltage range (90-264 VAC) and operating tempera­
tures of up to -40°C (also when starting) also offer a practical solu­
tion. Our GreenTech EC axial compact fans are available up to IP65 
as an option and, thanks to corresponding certificates, are also  
suitable for use with natural refrigerants.
Many years of experience, quality
and continuous product improvement
Better, in the same size. Our products have been developed for 
many years and have been optimized to meet your requirements. 
Our new generation of GreenTech EC axial compact fans offer  
a wealth of advantages in the same dimensions as conventional  
AC fans. This makes switching your applications to the new fans 
much easier.
Quiet is not always quiet when psychoacoustic,
subjective noise characteristics are at play.
As well as increasing efficiency, one of our main objectives when 
further developing the pure AC fan series into our AxiACi series is 
significantly reducing noise as much possible – both in the aerody-
namics and in the motor. In terms of aerodynamics, we achieve this 
with perfectly designed and coordinated fan housing/fan impeller 
combinations. A motor always generates vibrations that are trans-
mitted to your application. In the worst-case scenario, in sound- 
wave form, these are considered disruptive. In the development 
phase, this structure-borne noise is difficult to predict and varies 
from application to application. Our aim is to develop motors with 
as little structure-borne noise as possible so that this problem does 
not occur in the first place. With our AxiACi motor technology,  
we have succeeded.
If we look at the sum of the acceleration levels, ACmaxx and AC 
4656N are comparable. However, AxiACi120 has a noticeable  
lower base level and also significantly lower peaks during accele­
ration amplitudes and therefore its structure-borne noise is much 
less intrusive. As a result, it also offers noise benefits for sensitive 
applications.

Cost optimization
	
■
Lower energy costs due to greater efficiency  
A drive concept based on state-of-the-art GreenTech EC tech­
nology with outstanding motor efficiency level. The energy 
consumption is up to 80 % lower than in AC fans of the same size. 
The energy savings alone mean that the products pay for them-
selves after only a few months. The savings made over the entire 
service life, especially in systems with multiple fans, are worth it.
	
■
Reduction in logistics costs as independent from 
line frequency and line voltage 
The GreenTech EC axial compact fans are prepared for direct 
connection to all AC voltages and frequencies thanks to the 
""wide voltage capability"" of the fan. A certain speed version can 
be operated worldwide, regardless of the 110 VAC or 230 VAC 
power supply. Voltage and frequency fluctuations during the  
power supply operation are compensated automatically.  
This reduces logistics costs and makes warehousing easier.
	
■
Long service life 
The efficiency of GreenTech EC axial compact fans is up to 75% 
greater than that of conventional AC fans. This not only saves 
energy, it also means that the motor heats itself up less.  
The bearing system in particular responds positively to heating 
itself up less: the reason why the fans have a service life that is  
up to 70 % longer! This also extends the service and maintenance  
intervals significantly. Investments in replacement fans and 
down­
times, which are even more expensive, remain small 
enough to manage.
Higher performance
Unlike conventional AC technology, the state-of-the-art drive  
concept of this fan series is not linked to a fixed power frequency. 
This allows the motor speed to be increased over a wide range.  
This enables significantly higher air flow rates and significant  
pressure increases.
Flexibility and countless possible uses
	
■
IP65 provides protection against harmful environmental  
influences and harsh operating conditions
	
■
Natural refrigerant? No problem! 
Safety approvals according to DIN EN 60335-2-89, 60335-2-24, 
DIN EN 60079-7 enable use with natural, explosive refrigerants
	
■
Everything is possible, from standby mode, overload mode  
at peak times or night reduction to temperature-controlled,  
quiet operation. From speed monitoring to long-term function 
monitoring via alarm or speed signal, the fans offer optional  
interfaces that allow easy and quick implementation of opera­
tional monitoring.

Further information on these fan options can be found in  
the chapter ""DC compact fan specials"" on page 252.

AC axial fans
Product overview
The tried-and-tested AC fans from ebm-papst are used wherever DC voltage is not available.  
In addition to complete devices, you will also find fans without external housing. These offer  
benefits whenever the air duct design can be integrated in the device that is being ventilated.
 
AC fans are available in many sizes, with variants with exhaust or intake over struts  
– with plug connection or exposed connection wires. 
Fan drive using shaded-pole or capacitor motors based on the familiar external rotor principle.  
This construction combining high performance with profitability.
All fan types are designed in IP20 as standard.  
IP65 solutions and special protection types are available on request.

The air flow and sound level of fans without external housing depend on the installation conditions.
The stated air flow and noise have been measured with an orifice 76.5 mm Ø at a distance of approx. 17 mm from the mounting bracket.
The air flow capacity of fan series 8000 N is achievable because of the exceptionally favorable installation conditions.  
The noise in the optimal operating range can be measured for these fans only in a specific application.

304
Measuring conditions 
Air performance measured according to: ISO 5801. Installation category A, without contact protection.
Noise: Total sound power level LWA ISO 10302 measured on a hemisphere with a radius of 2 m. Sound pressure level LpA measured at 1 m 
distance from fan axis. The values given are applicable only under the specified measuring conditions and may differ depending on  
the installation conditions. In the event of deviation from the standard configuration, the parameters must be checked after installation!

Förderleistung und Geräusch von Lüftern ohne AußenHousing hängen von ihren Einbauverhältnissen ab.  
Der genannte Air flow wurde in einer Lochblende von Ø 109 mm und einem Abstand von ca. 17 mm vom Mounting bracket ermittelt.
Bei besonders günstigen Einbauverhältnissen sind die Förderleistungen der Serie 4000 Z erreichbar.  
Das Geräusch im optimalen Betriebsbereich kann für diese Lüfter nur im konkreten Anwendungsfall gemessen werden.

316
Measuring conditions 
Air performance measured according to: ISO 5801. Installation category A, without contact protection.
Noise: Total sound power level LWA ISO 10302 measured on a hemisphere with a radius of 2 m. Sound pressure level LpA measured at 1 m 
distance from fan axis. The values given are applicable only under the specified measuring conditions and may differ depending on  
the installation conditions. In the event of deviation from the standard configuration, the parameters must be checked after installation!

Product overview
AC centrifugal fans
The tried-and-tested AC fans from ebm-papst are used wherever DC voltage is not available. In  
addition to complete devices, you will also find fans without external housing. These offer econo-
mic benefits whenever the air duct design can be integrated in the device that is being ventilated.
 
AC centrifugal fans are available in many sizes with forward or backward-curved fan impeller.  
Depending on the installation situation, it is a pure fan impeller or is combined with a housing  
with optimized air flow and noise.
Fan drives through shaded-pole or capacitor motors usually incorporate the familiar external rotor 
principle. This design combines high performance with economic efficiency. ebm-papst also offers  
particularly flat AC fans with an internal rotor motor. The advantage of these is their fast start-up to  
full speed, resulting in lower mass moments of inertia.
All fan types are designed in IP20 as standard.  
IP54/IP68 solutions and special protection types are available on request.

Axial fans
ebm-papst's axial fans prove their reputation as space-saving wonders by moving air for hot or cold
air exchange in a wide variety of devices and systems. Their outstanding features are their small
installation depth, low noise level and exceptional efficiency, and are particularly well suited for air
flow through heat exchangers.
Furthermore, in the EC version, they become intelligent ""energy-saving wonders"" for an extremely
wide range of applications, primarily in ventilation, air-conditioning and refrigeration technology and
the automotive industry.
One principle, countless options
The axial fan, the function of which is similar to
a propeller, moves the air axially, parallel to the
revolving motor shaft. The ebm-papst external
rotor motor is integrated directly into the axial
impeller, forming a compact axial fan unit. They
are usually installed with wall rings in short or
long nozzles.
The extensive ebm-papst product range offers
the right solution for each requirement and is
classified for a wide variety of applications:
– S series with sickle-shaped blades for high
air flow at medium pressure
– K series with especially low noise level –
ideally suited for refrigeration plant
applications
– A series for high-pressure applications
is a registered trademark of ebm-papst Mulfingen GmbH & Co. KG
Design according to requirements
Energy efficiency, controllability and low-noise
performance – and all this together with
external rotor motors in AC and EC technology:
ebm-papst axial fans are optimally matched to
customer requirements.
The EC technology (12 VDC to 110 VDC or 
line-voltage-powered 100 VAC to 480 VAC) with
integrated or external electronics enables 
precision open and closed-loop control with
very high efficiency. The following standard
features are available:

Our history – Our drive
Rooted in ebm, PAPST and mvl, the three leading innovators in the
development and production of motors and fans, ebm-papst has
established itself as the world market leader. Now as ever, our legendary
inventive spirit shines through in products that set standards in many
segments of industry worldwide. We are proud to say that despite difficult
competition, our performance has always been exemplary and outstand-
ing – in business, in our personal relationship with our customers, and of
course with respect to technology and engineering. For decades, we have
contributed to the world of air technology and drive engineering with
small revolutions and large milestones.
To maintain this advantage in skills and knowledge to get maximum
quality and thus the highest degree of customer satisfaction, our
employees around the world put their passion and dedication to work
for you.
Passionately involved in R&D
Our catalogues just list the results of our incessant efforts in R&D:
products of highest quality and reliability. After all, it is our passion to
constantly try something new and improve what we have. In doing so,
we take advantage of the latest development methods and state-of-
the-art technology and invest quite heavily in R&D facilities. Best of all,
though, we rely on excellently trained and skilled engineers and
technicians to be at your service in R&D and Sales & Distribution.
Producing and safeguarding high-quality products and services
This is our promise without any compromise. Whether produced in one of
our five factories in Germany or one of our eleven international production
sites, our products always have the same high level of quality. This quality
control is something you can definitely rely on! And this across all levels
of production and throughout all processes: consulting customers, devel-
opment, material selection through to picking certified, choice suppliers
and on to the production of parts and final delivery. On top of this, our
products have to pass the most rigourous tests under all realistic operat-
ing conditions: continuous stress test, salt spray test, vibration test, or
precision noise measuring, just to mention a few. And the product gets
clearance for serial production only after all the
desired characteristics have been determined to
be just right.
Environmental care is another priority with 
ebm-papst. This is why we have developed
our product line in EC technology, which makes
for very low power consumption. Due to our
manufacturing philosophy, there is absolute
focus on environmental care in production,
recycling, waste and waste water disposal.
Global Domestic
In order to be specialist for customised solutions
throughout the world, you need strong partners.
Global Domestic – i.e. being present all over the
world and being a national company in each
individual country – is how we have established
ourselves in all important markets on this globe
with our successful subsidiaries. And so you will
always find ebm-papst close to home, speaking
your language, and knowing the demands of
your markets. Besides, our worldwide produc-
tion alliance serves as a basis for competitive
pricing. Our global services and logistic outlets,
i.e. IT networking, safeguard short reaction
times and just-in-time delivery.
All our efforts are documented in a comprehen-
sive quality management system, both for prod-
ucts and services. Being certified as complying
with the tough requirements of the international
standards DIN EN ISO 9001, ISO/TS 16949-2
and of standard DIN EN ISO 14001 is just one
seal of approval we have received for our
unceasing efforts to provide only the best
quality products and services.

Our key to success
Our innovations and technologies keep on turning into new industrial standards. This competitive capability can 
only be maintained by seeing ventilation as a whole: the interrelationship between, and thus the system of, motor
engineering, aerodynamics, and electronics. These are our three core competencies, imminently connected and
linked in each of our products. And so we handle air intelligently and quietly and continue to set new standards in
drive technology. Our system solutions form the main part of our product range by now. And they will be our main
key to success.
Motor engineering, aerodynamics, electronics
Our drive is well known and famous with specialists: our external-rotor
motor, which has made us world market leader – quietly, yet powerfully.
Being versatile as to integration, it is ideally suited to the most diverse
applications. Based on this principle, we here at ebm-papst have devel-
oped the widest range of fans and motor types in the world. And for hot 
or aggressive blower mediums, the internal-rotor motor is the perfect
complement.
Still, in drive engineering, certain applications simply require the internal-
rotor motor principle, and they are then realised with our motors specifi-
cally developed for such cases. Take, for instance, the steering support
motor in the automotive field developed as innovation in active steering.
Be it axial or centrifugal fans, centrifugal blowers, compact fans or
tangential blowers: we always design fan blades, impeller blades and
ducted housings with the specific application in mind. We strive to
minimise noise and to optimise efficiency. This is the challenge that 
we have taken up and which we meet – working away powerfully 
and quietly.
Finally, intelligence will become the decisive
factor on all markets in future. After all, only in
connection with electronics can drive and air
flow – as a system solution – have an optimal
effect in a product or application. Interfaces are
avoided, and thus potential faults and failures.
Setting new standards with EC technology
Wherever intelligent air handling is required,
where energy consumption needs to be reduced
and performance has to be maximised, there
our EC motors are your reliable answer. They do
not waste financial or natural resources.
Instead, they boost high efficiency, continuous
controllability via analogue or digital inputs,
long and maintenance-free service life, and
robustness.

Without any problems, the ebm-papst EC technology allows you to realise
networked, bus-linked appliances, to integrate simple or complex controls
at low cost and to also realise time and again new, customised and
complete solutions. Here, ebm-papst excels as competent development
partner, with our experience of more than 25 years and our excellent
know-how in R & D and production also being well documented in a few
hundred national and international patents. And there is also our ability 
to listen intently, to pay good attention to our customers and their
demands – in order to come up with new and pioneering ideas, such as:
– EC fan units for clean room technology.
As the electronics are integrated and the unit
is wired up completely and ready to plug in,
there is no need for our customers to waste
time and money on laborious wiring work.
– Sensitive EC sensor fans for the automotive
industry providing optimal selection of the
air-conditioning unit in the car and, combined
with booster blowers, individual air-condition-
ing of each and every passenger seat.
– EC gas blowers with commutation and
control electronics including a processor.
They are developed in such a way as to 
make the blower premix the required amount
of air with the gas. Aerodynamics with these
blowers are adjusted in such a way as to
make these blowers ideal for use in very
limited space at high back pressure.

Speed setting device
with housing
– Material: Housing made of plastic
– Type of protection: IP 54
– Design: The speed setting device can be operated with the entire range of ebm-papst 
EC fans. It is supplied with current via the fan's DC output and supplies a 0-10 V signal 
that allows infinitely variable open loop speed control. The control also permits fan speed
measurement using a multimeter equipped with a frequency meter (for which a tach output
is given from the fan).
– Cable inputs: 4 x M16 or M20
– Mounting holes: Suitable for 4 mm mounts
– Speed measurement: Connect a frequency meter to the connection points 
(labelled + and -) on the PCB board. The fan has an output of 1 pulse per 
revolution, so that the measured frequency can be converted into rpm using 
the following equation:
rpm = frequency (Hz) x 60
– Comment:
• A single controller can be used to control multiple fans with the same speed setting.
• The connection to the controller is made using four screw connections or one Molex
connection (adaptor lead available).
• If the tach cable is required, this device can only be connected to one fan. Note that in
rare operating cases, it is possible that permanent connection of the tach cable can
cause a slight decrease in the maximum speed.

– Pull-off protector: The housing expands 
by max. 9 mm. The protector responds to
overload by the generated excess pressure
snapping off the internal lead in a predeter-
mined breaking point.
– Mounting: c is the overall dimension of the
capacitor which has to be taken into account
when mounting the part. The capacitor
design, however, depends on the manufac-
turer. The expansion (9 mm) is either added
to dimension b, or it is already integrated in
the capacitor.

Technical parameters & scope
High standards for all ebm-papst products
Here at ebm-papst, we constantly strive to further improve our products in order to be able to offer you the best 
possible product for your application. Careful monitoring of the market ensures that technical innovations are 
reflected in the improvements of our products.
Based on the technical parameters listed below and the ambience you want our product to operate in,
we here at ebm-papst can always work out the best solution for your specific application.
General performance parameters
Any deviations from the technical data and parameters described here 
are listed on the product-specific data sheet.
Type of protection
The type of protection is specified in the product-specific data sheets.
Insulation class
The insulation class is specified in the product-specific data sheets.
Mounting position
The mounting position is specified in the product-specific data sheets.
Condensate discharge holes
Information on the condensate discharge holes is provided in the 
product-specific data sheets.
Mode of operation
The mode of operation is specified in the product-specific data sheets.
Protection class
The protection class is specified in the product-specific data sheets.
Service life
The service life of ebm-papst products depends on two major factors:
– The service life of the insulation system
– The service life of the bearing system
The service life of the insulation system mainly depends on voltage level,
temperature and ambient conditions, such as humidity and condensation.
The service life of the bearing system depends mainly on the thermal load
on the bearing.
The majority of our products use maintenance-free ball bearings for 
any mounting position possible. As an option, sleeve bearings can be
used, which is indicated on the product-specific data sheet wherever
applicable.
The service life L10 of the ball bearings can be taken as approx. 40,000
operating hours at an ambient temperature of 40 °C, yet this estimate 
can vary according to the actual ambient conditions.
We will gladly provide you with a lifetime calculation taking into account
your specific operating conditions.
Motor protection / thermal protection
Information on motor protection and thermal protection is provided in the
product-specific data sheets.
Depending on motor type and field of application, the following protective
features are realised:
– Thermal overload protection (TOP), either in-circuit or external
– PTC with electronic diagnostics
– Impedance protection
– Thermal overload protection (TOP) with electronic diagnostics
– Current limitation via electronics
If an external TOP is connected, the customer has to make sure to
connect a conventional trigger device for switching it off.
All fans with 1~ AC voltage are equipped with a TOP that is connected 
in the winding circuit.
Products without fitted TOP and without protection against improper use,
a motor protection complying with the valid standards has to be installed.

Measurement conditions for air and noise measurement
ebm-papst products are measured under the following conditions:
– Axial and centrifugal fans with direction of air flow ""V"", without guard
grille and in the wall ring
– Backward curved centrifugal fans, free-running and with inlet nozzle
– Forward curved single and dual inlet centrifugal fans with housing
Noise measurements
All noise measurements are carried out in low-reflective test rooms with
reverberant floor. Thus the ebm-papst acoustic test chambers meet the
requirements of precision class 1 according to DIN EN ISO 3745. For noise
measurement, the fans being tested are placed in a reverberant wall and
operated at nominal voltage (for AC, also at nominal frequency) without
additional attachments such as the guard grille.
Sound pressure level and sound level
All noise levels are measured in conformity to DIN 45635 and 
ISO 3744/3745 according to precision class 2 and specified A-weighted.
When the sound pressure level (Lp) is measured, the microphone is on 
the intake side of the fan being tested, usually at a distance of 1 m on 
the fan axis.
To measure the sound level (Lw), 10 microphones are distributed over 
an enveloping surface on the intake side of the fan being tested 
(see graphic). The sound level measured can be roughly calculated 
from the sound pressure level by adding 7 dB.
Measurement configuration according to DIN 45635 T38:

Adding multiple noise sources with the same level
Adding 2 noise sources with the same volume results in a level increase
of approx. 3 dB. The noise characteristics of multiple identical fans can 
be determined in advance based on the noise values specified in the data
sheet. This is shown in the diagram opposite.
Example: 8 A3G800 axial fans are on a condenser. According to the data
sheet, the sound pressure level of a fan is approximately 75 dB(A).
The level increase measured from the diagram is 9 dB. Thus the overall
sound level of the installation can be expected to be 84 dB(A).
Adding two noise sources with different levels
The acoustic performance of two different fans can be predetermined
based on the sound levels given in the data sheet. This is shown in the
diagram opposite.
Example: There is an axial fan A3G800 with a sound pressure level of
75 dB(A) at the operating point and an axial fan A3G710 with 71 dB(A) in
a ventilation unit. The level difference is 4 dB. The level increase can now
be read in the diagram as approx. 1.5 dB. This means that the overall
sound level of the unit can be expected to be 76.5 dB(A).
Inverse square laws
The sound level is independent of the distance from the noise source.
Conversely, the sound pressure level decreases as distance from the
noise source increases. The diagram to the right shows the level decrease
expressed in terms of an output measurement at a distance of 1 m from
the noise source under far-field conditions.
Example: An axial fan A3G800 has a sound pressure level of 75 db(A) at
the operating point. Now, you want to measure the noise characteristics at
a distance of 20 m. In the diagram to the right, you can now read a
reduction of 26 dB for the 20 m distance.

ebm-papst construction designs
Depending on the geometrical shape of the impeller, there are different
construction designs, with their names taken from the main flow 
direction in the impeller.
The most important designs are:
– Axial fans
– Centrifugal fans with backward curved blades
– Single or dual inlet centrifugal blowers with forward curved blades
– Diagonal (mixed flow) fans (a cross between axial and centrifugal fans)
Relevant fields of application of the various construction designs
The different ebm-papst fan and blower designs correspond to the 
different fields of application:
– Small back pressures: Axial fans
– High back pressures: Centrifugal fans with backward curved blades
and single or dual inlet centrifugal blowers
– Threshold between axial and centrifugal fans: Diagonal fans
Impellers
Impellers made by ebm-papst
Like pumps and compressors, fans and blowers belong to the category of aerodynamic and fluid work machines.
A fan consists of an impeller, a drive motor and a housing for suspension and for guiding the air flow. The blades spaced
along the circumference of the impeller are designed in such a way as to cause the flowing work medium to change
direction, thus passing on pressure and speed energy.
Application-specific selection parameters
When selecting an application-specific fan or blower, the main parameters
to be taken into account are these:
– Air flow at given back pressure
– Constructional design
– Speed/rpm
– Impeller diameter
– Ambient conditions governing suction and exhaust side

Air flow measurement for inlet nozzles 
with pressure-measuring point
The differential pressure approach compares the static pressure before
the inlet nozzle with the static pressure inside the inlet nozzle.
Air flow can be calculated on the basis of the differential pressure
(difference in pressure of the static pressures) in keeping with the
following equation:
V = k . ∆pW
V in [m3/h] and ∆pW in [Pa]
If constant air flow control is used, then the nozzle pressure has to be
kept constant:
∆pW = V2 : k2
k takes into account the specific nozzle characteristics.
One or four pressure measuring points are spaced along the 
circumference of the inlet nozzle. Connection on the customer side 
is accomplished via a premounted T tube connector. This tube connector
is suited for pneumatic hoses with an internal diameter of 4 mm.

a scroll housing.
A dual inlet centrifugal blower shows the same behaviour as two single
inlet blowers operated in parallel: with size, speed and pressure being
identical, double the air flow is achieved.

Effects caused by obstructions on the inlet side for constant air flow
EC centrifugal blowers
Constant air flow is attained with unimpaired inflow only.
An obstructed (e. g. asymmetrical or partially blocked) air flow can have a
significant effect on the curve behaviour and cause large deviations from
a constant air flow curve.
Examples of obstructed inflows
Instructions for designing a sufficiently unobstructed inflow:
– The distance x between the blower intake and neighbouring walls or
obstructions should be at least 25 % of the impeller diameter.
– Inflows with angular momentum or asymmetrical rotation should be
avoided.
– The inflow can be made more uniform using resistances such as those
from filters or grilles.
On request, we offer calibrated blower designs that incorporate a specific
installation situation.

Effects
The effects of the diagonal/mixed flow fan are similar to those listed 
for the axial fan (p. 397-400).

The saddle of the diagonal/mixed flow fan is slightly higher than that 
of the axial fan. This means that the technical ratings in the optimal
operating range are better than those of the axial fan.

Motors
Motors made by ebm-papst
In AC and EC technology, ebm-papst relies on the proven external-rotor motor principle, with the rotor turning 
around the stator within. Advantages of the ebm-papst external-rotor principle are:
– Space saving design due to integrated bearings and direct installation inside the impeller
– Lower load and more precise balancing of the bearing due to the fixed connection of all rotating elements
– Prolonged service life due to the motor-impeller unit placed right within the air flow
The ebm-papst motors achieve very good results in efficiency and acoustic behaviour when used in EC technology.

Control technology
Open and closed loop control using ebm-papst technology
Depending on the field of application, fan speed has to be adjusted. In AC technology, the speed setting option can 
result in an increase in installation expenditure and, typically, a less favourable noise performance and an increase in
power input.
Here, ebm-papst EC technology is a more eco-friendly and cost-efficient alternative. The EC motor with integrated 
commutation electronics offers high efficiency across the entire speed range and optimal acoustic performance 
at minimal installation expenditure.

The speed of EC motors is set via commutation electronics. Via electronic
circuits and depending on the rotor position, this commutation switches
the motor currents on and off.
Principle of AC-fed commutation electronics
(with electrically isolated interface)
Integrated commutation electronics
– Compact unit
– Easy to install
– Low installation expenditure
– Can be operated all over the world
Note: Motors with 12-72 VDC supply voltage have to be fed via 
electrically isolated supply unit.
Integrated commutation electronics with switch power supply
– Protective extra-low voltage 24 / 48 VDC
Note: Switch power supply is not included but has to be ordered 
as accessory.

Typical features of the ebm-papst commutation electronics:
– Input for analogue and digital signals
– Open and closed loop control as well as monitoring of the motor
– Integrated EMC filter
– High efficiency throughout the entire speed range
– Speed setting via linear set value (0-10 VDC) or PWM signal
– Low-noise operation across the entire speed range
– Minimal extra costs for additional functions 
(open/closed loop control)
– Optional BUS interface
Types of alarms and reactions with EC motors
With DC-fed EC motors, certain faults in modes of operation are
recognised by the electronics, and the motor is automatically restarted.
With AC-fed EC motors, certain faults in modes of operation are
recognised by the electronics, and the motor is switched off.
The motor restarts automatically after the following failures have been
diagnosed:
– Line failure
– Phase failure
– Line under-voltage
– DC link voltage too high or too low
– Locked rotor
With the following types of failures, there is no automatic restart.
Here, hardware or software reset is required:
– Motor temperature too high
– Temperature of cooling element or ambient temperature of 
electronics too high
– Hall failure
Hardware reset
Switching off the fan and restarting it after one minute results in 
hardware reset.
Software reset
Software reset is via ebmBUS and LISA software, hand-held control
terminal, or PDA with Fan Control Software.

Cable assemblies for every application
Wilcoxon Sensing Technologies builds cables to our exacting standards for a variety of applications:
Considerations for cable selection
Cable design
Description
Typical applications
Shielded, 
twisted pair
Shielded, twisted pair wire.
Permanent sensor installations most often use 2-wire 
shielded cable because it minimizes electrical noise, 
including RFI, ESD and EMI and is compatible with standard 
2-wire sensors.
Multi-conductor 
shielded
Shielded, twisted wire for use with 3, 
4 or 5 conductors.
Multi-conductor shielded cable is used with 3, 4 or 5 
conductor sensors because it minimizes electrical noise.
Coaxial
Carries power and signal on an inner 
conductor. The shield acts as the 
signal common.
Coaxial cable is used with BNC connectors and charge 
output accelerometers. Low-noise mineral insulation cable 
minimizes triboelectric effects.
Shielding
Description
Typical applications
Foil
Shielding made of aluminized 
mylar with a drain wire for electrical 
connection.
The foil blocks high levels of RF signal, which are often found 
in wind turbine nacelles or high-speed turbines.
Braided or spiral
Shielding is provided by a braid 
made from many strands of small 
gauge wire and wrapped around the 
conductor(s) of a cable.
Braided shielding is considered more effective at minimizing 
power line frequencies found around electric motors. Tightly 
wound braided shield also protects against RF interference.

Selecting the right cable assembly for a sensor is highly dependent on factors in the environment in which 
the sensor will operate. It’s important to consider the application and the environment to ensure data 
reliability.
An applications support specialist can help you determine the cable, protection level and connector fittings 
that meet your needs. Custom cable orders are usually built in less than a week, and many standard cables 
ship the next day. All cable assemblies are built with care and precision to ensure the quality you’ve come to 
expect from Wilcoxon.

MaxFlex® cables
Cable protection
Description
Typical applications
Spiral armored 
jacket
Spiral wrap, interleaved band of 
metal surrounding a cable.
The spiral armored jacket protects the cable from heavy objects 
such as those found in a hot roll steel mill, and provides chemical 
resistance due to the cable’s complete isolation from the 
atmosphere.
Stainless steel 
overbraid
Braided electrical shield of 
stainless steel wrapped along 
the outside of a cable.
A stainless steel overbraid protects the cable from sharp objects 
and can act as an additional signal shield. For underwater 
applications, the braid protects the outer insulation from foreign 
objects and does not trap water.
Environmental resistance
Description
Typical applications
Teflon®
Best temperature resistance, 
excellent chemical resistance.
The cable jacket of choice for most applications. Teflon can 
withstand temperatures up to 260°C, making it ideal for high 
temperature environments. Teflon is resistant to most chemicals 
and physically strong, providing long cable life.
Enviroprene
Better chemical resistance in 
non-abrasive environments.
A low-cost alternative to Teflon. Enviroprene is useful for most 
environments and protects against common exposures, such as 
UV rays found in outdoor cable tray installations.
PVC
Good chemical resistance.
PVC is a low-cost solution for dry air installations, but does not 
provide the same range of chemical resistances as Teflon.
Tefzel®
Better chemical resistance, 
rated for use in areas where 
radiation is present.
Radiation resistance makes Tefzel appropriate for use in nuclear 
environments.
Polyurethane
Low-cost, waterproof material 
with good abrasion resistance.
Polyurethane is often used in underwater applications because it 
can be bonded to metals, creating a watertight seal to the sensor.

MaxFlex cables for data collectors are designed for high performance in the harsh environments of route-
based data collection. With reinforced cable joints at the sensor connector end – the most common point of 
failure for similar cables due to severe handling – MaxFlex cables are reliable, durable, and resistant to wear 
and tear. They are also compatible with data collectors made by SKF, Emerson (CSI), Rockwell (Entek/IRD), 
and GE (Commtest).
>>   Extended life
     >>   Reinforced for strength and 
              maximum flexibility
           >>   Pull tested to over 100 pounds
                >>   Excellent EMI / RFI shielding

Durable connectors – built to last
Description
Typical applications
MIL-style
Rugged, simple and cost-effective 
connectors available in a variety of 
pin configurations.
MIL-style is the most common connector used with industrial 
sensors. They are rugged and offer a wide variety of boots 
and sealing methods for use in different environments, 
including splashproof options.
Multi-conductor
LEMO, Bendix, Turck, M12 
and other multi-conductor 
connections.
Multi-conductor connectors are used on data collectors, 
multi-axis sensors, dual output sensors and triaxial units. M12 
connectors are commonly used in process applications.
Coaxial
2-pin connectors for use with 
coaxial cables.
BNC and 10-32 Microdot connectors reduce the collection 
time associated with portable data collection.
Connector types
With a wide variety of pin configurations, options for electrical isolation between shield and transducer 
housing, data collector-compatible connectors and connectors for permanent sensor installations, Wilcoxon 
has what you need. We offer connector options for a broad range of sensor types, designed to perform 
under the conditions of any industrial environment.
For harsh environments
Wilcoxon’s model 6Q (2-pin MIL-C-5015 connector) boot used with a Teflon® coated cable, such as model 
J9T2A, has set the standard for ruggedized, submersible connector-cable assemblies. Rated IP68 and 
tested up to 650 psi, 6Q connectors are usable in temperatures up to 200°C and underwater submersible to 
a depth of 230 feet. The design of the 6Q allows it to be used both in settings where the cable shield must 
be connected to the sensor body, and in industrial applications where the shield must be isolated from the 
sensor (made possible by removing the grounding spring). The pairing of the 6QN neoprene boot and J9T2 
Tefzel® cable is an ideal configuration for nuclear environments.
For process applications, Wilcoxon offers the new 6H, 6HI and 6HD2 connectors, designed for use with 
HART-compatible PCH420V sensors. The 6HD2 boot is suitable for Class I, Division 2 hazardous areas.

Splashproof connectors used with sensors are categorized 
by Ingress Protection or IP rating. IP ratings are industry 
standards that indicate how connectors withstand invasion 
in harsh environments. In order to understand the level of 
sealing provided by a sensor connector, use the chart below.
IP ratings
Cable length
An accelerometer cable can be run 100 feet without losing signal 
content. The exact length before signal degradation begins can be 
determined using cable capacitance (30 pico-Farads per foot is 
common) and available voltage swing (typically at least 5 V peak-
to-peak). Using these values, the maximum length is a function 
of supply current and the highest frequency of interest. The chart 
below helps determine maximum cable lengths.
